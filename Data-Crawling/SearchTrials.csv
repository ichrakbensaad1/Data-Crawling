"PACTR201301000446118","Ureteral stenting in orthotopic bladder substitutes","Perioperative stenting with external ureteral catheters versus internal double J stents in orthotopic bladder substitutes: a prospective randomized trial","              Necessity of routine ureteral stenting following urinary diversion is universally accepted and a  recent randomized trial provided an evidence that ureteroileal anastomosis stenting allows for significantly less frequent incidence of early postoperative dilatation of the pelvicaliceal system with significantly earlier return of bowel activity and significantly less frequent metabolic acidosis .  The ureteral double pigtail stents are versatile and valued for proper urinary drainage in the setting of trauma, fistula formation, after extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Two decades ago, Walther et al., did not recommend the use of internal stenting in this setting as it might induce lethal sepsis and death and suggested urologists to await further evolution in stent technology . Recently, two non randomized trials had provided the evidence that use of internal double J stents could be utilized safely in urinary diversion patients with significant reduction of hospital stay with earlier mobilization and minimal discomfort and without increase in ureteral stricture rates. We aimed to compare two group of patients with orthotopic ileal bladder substitution adopting two different types of uretero-ileal stenting ; external ureteroileal stents versus internal double J stents  in a prospective controlled randomized trial

This surgery may be followed by clinical or subclinical hepatocellular derangements, metabolic insufficiency, hemodynamic changes and impairment of pulmonary gas exchange, which could lead to postoperative hepatic and multiorgan dysfunction. Target controlled infusion (TCI) of opioids and propofol were advocated to  provide anaesthesia for major liver resection aiming to  fasten patient recovery with minimal stay in the  postoperative intensive care.

The study will be in two phases, at the end of the first phase the patients will switch to the other agent. In phase one of the study, children will be randomly selected into two groups, group PK will receive ketofol (1:1 mixture of propofol and ketamine), and group MK will receive a mixture of midazolam (0.05mg/kg) and ketamine (1.5mg/kg).  Each phase will consist of two sessions of sedation procedure, at three weeks interval per patient. In phase two of the study, the patients in group PK that received ketofol will now switch to midazolam/ketamine mixture and vice versa for those in group MK.

It ensures child¿s growth, protects against common acute childhood infections, decreases the rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, promotes cognitive development and, prevents atopic diseases, obesity and diabetes mellitus. For the mother, breastfeeding is economic, ensures maternal-child bonding, postpartum weight loss and birth spacing. Furthermore, breastfeeding protects against breast and ovarian cancers. The WHO and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six month. Despite this recommendation, rates of children breastfed exclusively up to six months remain low worldwide. The lack of breastfeeding support received by mothers from heath care providers is an important contributory factor of early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the training of health care providers in Baby friendly Hospital Initiative on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding in Kinshasa.
Mothers were randomly allocated to one of the two groups. In the intervention group, mothers benefited of breastfeeding counseling supposed improved by the training of health care providers on the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. Indeed, we assumed that, due to the training of health care providers, breastfeeding counseling might be improved and might result in the reduction of the risk of discontinuing breastfeeding before six months. In the control group, mothers continued to receive routine breastfeeding counseling provided by non-retrained health workers.
Mothers were recruited during antenatal care visits two weeks after the end of the training of health care providers, and followed up to six month after the childbirth.

Approved therapy for this infection includes interferon (&2 and B) and the nuceoside analogues lamivudine, entecavir, adefovir, tenofovir, and telbivudine). Their efficacy in most studies has varied from about 30 to 60%, and is influenced by viral and host factors. Besides the very high cost of these medications which makes them unaffordable by majority of patients. Some products like lamivudine have low barrier to resistance. Hence the need for affordable, cheap, and affordable agents.

Alternative, more effective drugs are needed and gemcitabine is one of those drugs that have shown response rates with fewer side effects in this set up. We have observational data on gemcitabine when used as a second line drug after failure of bleomycin, vincristine and doxorubicin cobination. This prelimary observational study produced a 48% response rate.

NO is produced in the vascular endothelium from l arginine as a response to physical and receptor stimulation, by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which is known to be a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme. NO is a radical compound due to having a single unmatched electron inits outer shell. It is not toxic in low concentrations. While NO plays an important role in the management of cardiovascular function, neurotransmission, and blood pressure, it also bears importance with regard to immune system (5).Volatile agents have been reported to inhibit endothelialand neuronal NOS by way of inhibiting intracellular calcium Mobilization (5)

Also, anaesthesia affects the immune response with the release of different cytokines which affect the inflammatory response in the postoperative period.
Among the cytokines which affect these responses were the Tumour Necrosis Factor ¿ (TNF-¿), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10). Cytokines are intracellular regulatory proteins acting through specific receptors, and have a major role in the immune response and inflammatory changes caused by surgery or infection.
There are two main groups of cytokines; proinflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages mainly acting through upregulation of inflammatory reactions and anti-inflammatory cytokines acting through the downregulation of inflammatory reactions.
The balance between the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-¿ and IL-6) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) limit the spread of infection, tissue injury and promote tissue healing and repair by their local and systemic effects (4-6).
It has been shown that there are differences between intravenous and volatile anaesthetics in their effects on the immune response (7-8).Isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit natural killer (NK) function to a greater degree than propofol.
Aim of the study
The aim of the present study was to compare the influence of anaesthesia using Isoflurane versus combined isoflurane - epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer on immune response and plasma concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins IL-6 , IL-10 and TNF-¿.

Colonic obstruction is mostly caused by carcinoma of the left colon; up to 20% of patients with colonic cancer present with symptoms of acute obstruction, but diverticulitis of the sigmoid, colonic volvulus and endometriosis may also cause acute obstruction. Several options exist for the emergency management of obstructed left colon lesions. Hartmann's procedure is performed in case of high risk of anastomotic dehiscence but up to 60% of stomas are never reversed, the expense and morbidity of the takedown procedure are significant and the patients have to make physical and psychological adjustments to live with a stoma. Subtotal and total colectomy should be attempted when caecal perforation is eminent or in case of synchronous colonic neoplasm. However, reduced capacity rectal stump leads to frequent passage of stool, affecting the quality of life. When skills and equipments are available, colonic stents tend to be an acceptable option in the palliative setting but a definitive solution can't be achieved if used alone. Based on the successful experiences of urgent colon surgery for penetrating trauma and in elective colonic anastomosis without previous preparation, studies have shown that primary colonic anastomosis is safe even though mechanical bowel preparation was not performed before surgery.  Resection with immediate anastomosis has recently found its place in managing emergency presentations of diverticular disease, sigmoid volvulus and undoubtedly, obstructed malignant colonic strictures. Simultaneous reconstruction after segmental resection can be performed by manual decompression either with or without on table colonic lavage.
The idea of intra-operative lavage is to clean the bowel from any solid fecal matter thereby decreasing chances of contamination.","RCT","Not Applicable","RCT","Treatment: Surgery","","4/14/2016 12:00:00 AM","3/1/2016 12:00:00 AM","5/14/2016 12:00:00 AM","5/14/2016 12:00:00 AM","212","212","Closed to recruitment,follow-up continuing","","False","Single Site","Digestive System; Surgery; Other","surgical outecomes of managment of obstructed left colon","faculty of medicine, alexandria university, egypt","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","","","","","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Control Group; Experimental Group","immediate anastomosis; on-table colonic lavage","Simultaneous reconstruction after segmental resection of left colon; on-table colonic lavage after resection followed by anastomosis","Simultaneous reconstruction after segmental resection ; on-table colonic lavage after resection followed by anastomosis","Simultaneous reconstruction after segmental resection ; on-table colonic lavage after resection followed by anastomosis","108; 104","Active-Treatment of Control Group; ","- Causes were either, malignant strictures of the left side of the colon at or below the splenic flexure.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) such as aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab have become the standard of care for diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema (ME) following retinal vein occlusions (RVO), and neovascular age related macular degeneration(nvAMD). Aflibercept has been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of DME, nvAMD, and ME following RVO. The recommended dose of intravitreal aflibercept is 2mg in 0.05ml administered monthly or initial monthly injections for the first 3 months followed by 2 monthly injections. Aflibercept is highly expensive (USD1850 per dose) and not available in many developing countries including Ghana. Ziv-aflibercept, a molecule structurally identical to aflibercept but differs due to its formulation with hyper-osmolality has been approved by the USA FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers. Ziv-aflibercept, used off-label, has been found to be safe in patients with DME and nvAMD in phase 1 trials at a dose of 1.25mg in 0.05ml. The cost of compounded ziv-aflibercept is much reduced to USD 67 per dose. The 1.25mg dose of ziv-aflibercept is below that recommended for intravitreal injections of aflibercept. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no data available on the safety of 2mg of ziv-aflibercept, although in vitro studies indicate that it is safe. Furthermore, there is no data on the intravitreal administration of ziv-aflibercept in the Ghanaian population to date. Specific Objectives: 1.To determine the safety of intravitreal injections of ziv-aflibercept at 4 and 12 weeks in a Ghanaian population. 2.To measure  the visual outcome of treatment with 1.25mg  and 2mg  ziv-aflibercept in eyes with DME, nvAMD,and ME secondary to RVO at 12 weeks.3.To measure the anatomic changes using SD-OCT in eyes with DME, nvAMD and ME secondary to   RVO at 12 weeks.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Treatment: Other","","2/1/2017 12:00:00 AM","2/1/2017 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","20","20","Not yet recruiting","","False","Single Site","Eye Diseases; Other","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Participants; Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors","Experimental Group; Control Group","intravitreal ziv-aflibercept; intravitreal  ziv-aflibercept 1.25mg","2mg monthly injection; 1.25mg/0.05ml monthly","3 months; 3 months","intravitreal injection will be done using a sterile technique.

"PACTR201710002161189","Comparative Study between the Effect of Dexmedetomidine versus Nalbuphine as an Adjuvant to Bupivacaine in Paravertebral Block in Breast Cancer Surger","Comparative Study between the Effect of Dexmedetomidine versus Nalbuphine as an Adjuvant to Bupivacaine in Paravertebral Block in Breast Cancer Surgery","Abstract

Background: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women worldwide. Many patients are frequently admitted to the operating theaters for mastectomies. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is increasingly used as an effective mean for post-operative pain relief. 

Aim of the study: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexmeditomedine and  nalbuphine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine local anesthetic in thoracic paravertebral block in cancer  breast surgeries.

Patients and Methods:  Sixty (60) patients included in the study of ASA ¿, ¿, III were scheduled for mastectomy. These patients were randomly allocated into three groups (20) patients each: Group PB received bupivacaine (0.3 ml/ kg) + 1 ml normal saline. Group PBD received bupivacaine (0.3 ml/kg) + dexmeditomedine 1µg/kg. Group PBN received bupivacaine ( 0.3 ml/kg) and 10 mg (1 ml) nalbuphine.

Results: There was no statistically significant differences among the three groups regarding  demographic data, SPO2, ETCO2, HR,SBP and DBP intraoperatively. No significant difference in HR, SBP and DBP postoperatively. Postoperative pain scores were significantly higher in  group BP whether at rest or movement. The sedation was significantly higher in PBD group in the early 12 hours postoperatively. Significantly lower postoperative tramadol consumption in PBN group. significantly longer time to first analgesic request (TFR) than other groups. No complications reported in any group.

Conclusion:  Addition of nalbuphine 10 mg as an adjuvant to bupivacaine local anesthetic in TPVB improved quality of the block and decrease postoperative analgesic requirements than bupivacaine only group and dexmeditomedine and bupivacaine group. But, adding dexmeditomedine to bupivacaine increase the time to first analgesic request and more sedation than bupivacaine and bupivacaine and nalbuphine.

The major diseases associated with obesity include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis, as well as certain types of cancer; there are also many additional less known complications of the disease (Bray, 1985). Overweight and obesity now ranks as the fifth highest global risk factor for mortality and is the cause of an estimated 35.8 million (2.3%) of global DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost (WHO, 2010). In a systematic review on the prevalence of overweight and obesity of adult Nigerians, Chukwuonye et al. (2013) reported that the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals in Nigeria is of epidemic proportions. There is therefore, a need to pay closer attention to combating these health disorders. People generally become obese when, over a period of time, their energy intake exceeds their energy expenditure (National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2006). There is epidemiological evidence that an inverse relationship exists between physical activity and body weight, and that body fat is more favourably distributed in individuals who are physically active (Anderson et al., 1991; Wing et al., 1991 and  Di Pietro, 1995).  
Studies have shown that both continuous endurance exercise as well as high-intensity interval exercise increase fat oxidation post-training, but it is unclear which training protocol elicits the greater adaptation in overweight and obese females (Manning, 2011).Therefore, this study is designed to assess the efficacy of two different training modes of exercise in reversing the anthropometric, cardiovascular and metabolic features of overweight and obesity in females. This study will contribute to the recent recommendations to explore further the effective mechanism of exercise training in weight management. The result from this study will also contribute to the already existing guidelines for exercise prescription in weight management.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Physical activity and nutrition","","1/11/2016 12:00:00 AM","3/7/2016 12:00:00 AM","7/14/2017 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","105","97","Closed to recruitment,follow-up continuing","","False","Multiple Sites Single Nation","Genetic Diseases; Nutritional, Metabolic, Endocrine; Other","","","Factorial: participants randomly allocated to either no, one, some or all interventions simultaneously","Randomised","","","","","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Experimental Group; Experimental Group; Control Group","Interval Exercise Group; Continuous Exercise Group; Control Group","Three time a week; Three time a week; Three time a week","Ten weeks; Ten weeks; Ten weeks","It involves 30 seconds of high intensity exercise followed by 90 seconds low intensity exercise in the ratio 1: 1.5.

Acute postoperative pain is a  risk factor for   chronic postoperative pain after breast surgery [3]  Effective postoperative pain
management  is necessary.

Systemic opioids can be administered using patient-controlled devices but the analgesic effect can be limited and undesirable side effects may occur. [4]

Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) consists in the administration of a local anesthetic
solution close to the spinal cord nerve roots after their exit from the intervertebral foramen [5, 6]. Injection into the thoracic paravertebral space through a catheter demonstrates
vertical diffusion lateral to the vertebral column between the parietal pleura and the endothoracic fascia [7, 8]. Continuous paravertebral nerve block has the advantages of equivalent analgesia as an epidural technique but with less risk of block failure, dural puncture, cord trauma, and clinically significant side effects, including hypotension. Additionally, urinary catheterization is not necessary. [9]

Pectoral nerve (Pecs) blocks are ultrasound guided interfascial plane blocks that target tissue planes between the pectoralis major and minor (Pecs I), and the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles (Pecs II) [10,11]. Targeting these planes with local anesthetic blocks the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, anterior divisions of the thoracic intercostal nerves from T2 to T6, long thoracic nerve, and thoracodorsal nerves providing analgesia to the anterior and lateral thoracic walls with an extension into axilla. Pecs blocks have shown excellent efficacy for analgesia after breast surgery.[12]

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and most of them require breast surgery. [1] Surgery is associated with nausea vomiting, postoperative pain and chronic pain. Acute postoperative pain is an important risk factor for the development of persistent chronic postoperative pain after breast surgery. [2] Therefore, effective postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery is necessary. Effective analgesia reduces perioperative morbidity, shortens hospitalization times, improves patient satisfaction, and lowers cost
When fentanyl was used as adjuvant to local anesthetic, it improved the quality of block and prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia, without increasing the side effects. When fentanyl was used as adjuvant to local anesthetic, it improved the quality of block and prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia, without increasing the side effects.  It has been reported that opioid receptors are expressed by central and peripheral neurons especially within injured tissues and can attenuate the excitability of primary afferent neurons and lead to anti-nociceptive effects [17].

The study of the paradoxical effects of ultra- low-dose naloxone or naltrexone started over 20 years ago, with the initial finding that while opioid agonists normally inhibit, or shorten, the action potential duration of dorsal root ganglion cells, lower doses of opioid agonists induce an opposite, excitatory effect: a prolongation of the action potential. [18,19]  Ultra-low-dose (pg¿gg/kg) of naloxone combined with opioid agonists can improve their analgesic efficacy [20] via blocking the excitatory opioid receptor pathway and enhancing opioid analgesia [21,22,23] but not used before with fentanyl as adjuvants to the local anesthetic in paravertebral  anesthesia.

Nearly 40% of postoperative breast surgery patients experience significant acute postoperative pain with a pain score above 5 reflecting the inadequacy of conventional pain management (2).
Thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) is used for pain relief after thoracotomy and mastectomy. PVB can provide profound, long-lasting sensory deafferentation. The resulting greater attenuation of surgical stress response may translate into reduced inotropic stress response of the heart.
 If quality and duration of analgesia of PVB can be improved by adding adjuvants to local anesthetic (LA), its benefits can be maximized (4).Nalbuphine, a derivative of 14-hydroxymorphine is a strong analgesic with mixed k agonist and µ antagonist properties. The analgesic potency of nalbuphine has been found to be equal to morphine but unlike morphine, it exhibits a ceiling effect on respiratory depression(5). Nalbuphine has the potential to maintain or even enhance µ-opioid based analgesia while simultaneously mitigating the µ-opioid side effects(5).It had been used successfully and safely in epidural and intrathecal blocks(5-6).","RCT","Not Applicable","","Prevention","","12/1/2017 12:00:00 AM","12/2/2017 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2018 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","60","60","Not yet recruiting","","False","Single Site","Cancer; Surgery; Other","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Control Group; Experimental Group; Experimental Group","Group(PB) given bubivacaine0.5%; Group(PBN 1) will be given bubivacaine0.5%  plus 10 mg nalbuphine in 1ml,; Group(PBN 2) ","  0.3 ml/kg once; will be given bubivacaine0.5%  plus 10 mg nalbuphine in 1ml,; will be given bubivacaine0.5%  plus 20 mg  nalbuphine in 1ml., once","","","20; 20; 20","Active-Treatment of Control Group; ; ","Sixty )60( patients American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I/II/III females, aged (18-78) years, undergoing breast surgery will be studied.

Ethiopia is one of the countries with high breast cancer burden and faces the challenges from its devastating effects in terms of morbidity and mortality. According to the 2016 National Cancer Registry report of Ethiopia, it accounts for 33.4% of total cancer diagnoses in women. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and evaluate community based intervention on breast cancer screening behavior among Ethiopian women.
Methods and materials: A community based randomized controlled trial proceeded by cross sectional study lasting for six months will be conducted in Hadiya Zone, Ethiopia. For this, thirty clusters will be randomized by multistage cluster randomization technique, and allocated into two groups by permutation balanced block randomization. A total of 810 participants will be enrolled to the study by systematic random sampling technique. Educational intervention will be provided for the intervention group, while control group will be followed without any intervention. Structured questionnaire will be used for data collection. For data analysis, multilevel logistic regression model will be used to consider for the intra-cluster correlation effect. Individual participants will be considered at the first level and each cluster considered at second level.   
Conclusion: This will be the first study of its kind in Ethiopia to design and evaluate community based intervention on breast screening uptake. Therefore, it gives the opportunity to recognize the value of interventions and explore new intervention mechanism with an accurate method rather than the mere description of the problem.

Pain & Palliative Care Unit of UNTH, attends to patients in South-East Nigeria on out-patient basis at least once a month with phone calls made once a month by unit to each patient. Many patients living in the rural areas default from follow-up visits; those who do not default make requests to be given long appointments citing transportation difficulties, far distances from rural abode to hospital and lack of finances as reasons. Also, some patients develop poor/non-compliance to prescribed medications making symptom management difficult. In addition, nurses in team have difficulty eliciting accurate information about patients symptoms during crisis using phone calls (telephone-mediated care/teletriage) and many patients end up deteriorating/dying before they can get valuable medical help, especially during ¿out-of-hours¿ (after 4pm daily, weekends).
Use of mobile app to monitor symptoms in addition to their pre-scheduled hospital appointments will ensure best form of prompt intervention in symptom management, especially when compared with telephone-mediated care added to pre-scheduled hospital appointments and when compared with pre-scheduled hospital appointments only, leading to significant improvement with patient symptom management, patient compliance with appointments, medication use and medical instructions, improvement in patients¿ quality of life, satisfaction with palliative care received and reduction of family caregiver burden.","RCT","Not Applicable","EPAC","Supportive care","","3/1/2017 12:00:00 AM","4/15/2017 12:00:00 AM","11/1/2017 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","120","120","Completed","","False","Single Site","Cancer; Other","UNTH/CSA/329/Vol.5.NHREC/05/01/2008B","Univerity of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Research and Ethics Committee Approval","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study; Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised; Randomised","; ","; ","; ","Sealed opaque envelopes; Sealed opaque envelopes","Open-label(Masking Not Used); Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Experimental Group; Experimental Group; Control Group","App group; Phone call group; Control group","","3 months; 3 months; 3 months","Daily reports sent via mobile phone app twice daily, minimum once daily; reminder by assigned nurse via phone call; monthly pre-scheduled clinic visits; Evaluation of  Quality of life, Patient satisfaction with care, Family caregiver burden; Daily phone calls made to patient by assigned palliative care nurse, in addition to monthly pre-scheduled clinic visits and assessment ofQuality of life, Patient satisfaction with care recieved and Family caregiver burden; family caregivers assessed where present; patients assigned to this group given initial month pre-scheduled appointments; no follow-up calls or contact by assigned nurse for subsequent visits except for patients who honour preceding appointment","40; 40; 40","; ; ","Consenting adults (>/=18 years)

"PACTR201802003034110","Magnesium infiltraion for mastectomy","Magnesium Sulphate infiltration for postoperative analgesia following mastectomy. A randomized controlled trial."," Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among Egyptian women as it represents 32.04% of all cancers according to the latest epidemiologic study, with an expected 20% increase in number of patients by year 2020.
Modified Radical Mastectomy(MRM) entails extensive tissue dissection with axillary lymph node evacuation resulting in significant acute postoperative pain in about 40% of patients.Wound infiltration with local anesthetics is important in multimodal analgesia. Unfortunately the analgesic effect is related to the local anesthetics duration of action, approximately 4¿8 h in case of bupivacaine or ropivacaine. Magnesium plays a major role in antinociception as it is a naturally occurring calcium competitor and a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Studies have shown better postoperative analgesia when magnesium was administered directly to the surgical area compared to systemic administration.    
 We hypothesized that infiltrating magnesium in pectoralis major muscle would greatly improve functional recovery following MRM especially during arm movement compared to local anesthetic wound infiltration alone.
¿Our primary objective was to assess acute postoperative pain at rest and during arm movement. 
Secondary objectives included quality of analgesia based on time to first demand for rescue analgesia, number of analgesic demands, 24h cumulative analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting, wound hematoma  or any complication during the 24 hour observation period.

Recent systematic reviews and clinical trials [27-30] failed to provide adequate evidence and are unable to support or refute the use of compression garment during exercising.  On the other hand, the varied effects of compression use during exercising include reducing limb volume to causing  temporary increases in swelling [27-29].  The controversy of the results from previous studies may be due to the use of single bouts of exercise versus regular exercises, lack of sampling calculation, and absence of blinding and limited follow-up periods [28-33]. The National Lymphedema Network (NLN) currently supports the use of compression garment during exercise in patients with lymphedema. The compression garment fitting should be handled professionally, using at least Class I compression of 20-30 mmHg for lymphedema in the upper extremity [34].

These are associated with many complications like paraplegia and serious neurological complications.Ultrasound guided anterior approach gives the operator and the patient many advantages including the ability to identify the true location of the celiac plexus even if it was displaced due to the mass effect. also, the use of the supine position  is much more comfortable for the patient,and more importantly the prevention of the neurological and radiation risks.The use of alcohol for neurolysis is evidenced by many studies, however the data regarding the volume of alcohol injected is not consistent.The destructive effect of the alcohol is not limited to the celiac plexus nervous tissue alone, but rather it affects all the soft tissues encountered by the injected volume . Balancing between the neurolytic effect and the destructive effect is the rule of the volume of alcohol used.

Based on reports from WHO 2013, an estimated 275,000 women died, and 500,000 new cervical cancer cases reported every year. In Sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 57,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred in the year 2000. A report from Pathfinder Ethiopia 2010 showed that cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among Ethiopian women; 7,600 were diagnosed with the disease and roughly 6,000 women die each year. Few studies were done in Ethiopia related to cervical cancer.  
As a primary prevention, there is an experience with Health education intervention in the world (in Jamaica, Nigeria); which provides a great improvement in responses to questions about cervical cancer and its management. The screening rate in Ethiopia is low (0.8%); and still, the dominating barriers are community awareness, knowledge, and fear of the procedure. Though those barriers to cervical cancer screening, there is no community-based health education interventions. 
Objectives: The objective of the study is to assess community demand, the impact of health education intervention on demand of adult women towards cervical cancer screening, barriers and the challenges of cervical cancer service delivery among adult women in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia.

In a high-income setting, rehabilitation is a well-established evidence-based treatment modality for NCD yet this model is unlikely translated into a low-resource, public health care, sector. Hence, there is a dearth of robust evidence and knowledge about how to (cost)effectively deliver and study patient-centred rehabilitation for NCDs within a low-resource setting.

Unfortunately, its use especially in high doses, is associated with the adverse side effect of hyperglycemia amongst these patients. The study aims to seek the possibility of averting this associative side effect by using metformin,an oral hypoglycemic agent, to prevent this increase in blood glucose, while conferring minimal risk to the patient .It aims to establish whether any comparable differences are observed amongst the patients on metformin(the intervention group)and those without metformin(the control group).
The objective is to assess the effectiveness of metformin in the prevention of prednisone-induced hyperglycemia among adult hematological cancer patients receiving high-dose prednisone at Kenyatta National Hospital.
Specific objectives include:
1.	To determine the incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes among adult hematological cancer patients receiving prednisone-based regimens with no metformin prophylaxis of prednisone-induced hyperglycemia  
2.	To assess the effectiveness of Metformin in preventing prednisone-induced hyperglycemia among adult hematological cancer patients receiving high-dose prednisone.
3.	To compare the postprandial blood glucose levels achieved by single versus double daily metformin dosing among adult hematological cancer patients receiving high-dose prednisone.

However, a large gap is evident, as the bulk of research evidence is often generated in high-income countries (HIC), while the burden of disease and ill-health occur predominantly in LMICs. It is not known whether or how interventions generated in HIC may work in local low and middle-income country (LMIC) settings with different religious, socio-economic and cultural environments. 
Religious environments play an important role in promoting physical activity and healthy eating. In addition, the use of mobile phones has increased tremendously in Nigeria over the past 15 years. Nigeria ranks second, only to South Africa, with the highest proportion of mobile phone users in Africa. This may provide a window of opportunity to develop mobile phone interventions to promote physical activity (PA) and healthy food consumption (HFC) as has been done in some HIC. Few interventions have considered the use of faith-based text message prompters to improve the effect of interventions in faith-based settings and none of these studies were conducted in a highly religious low-and-middle income country (LMIC) like Nigeria. 
The primary objective of this study is to design and determine the feasibility and initial effects of a cultural adaptation of the effective components of two National Cancer Institute (NCI) evidence-based interventions in church settings, i.e., Body and Soul and the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit, to increase physical activity (PA) and health food consumption (HFC) in a church-based LMIC setting. The secondary objective is to understand how faith-based text messages may be used to improve the effects of this adapted intervention.

"PACTR201810868530360","Anesthetic technique and oxidative stress during radical mastectomy.","Oxidative stress in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy under sevoflurane compared to total intravenous anesthesia","Anesthetic techniques might have influential roles in the recurrence rate following breast cancer surgery (1). 
There is a growing body of evidence that the use of inhaled anesthetics such as sevoflurane has been associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased oxidative stress (2), Contradictory, intravenous propofol has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects (3). 

Oxidative stress results from Imbalance between the production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their elimination by the antioxidant system. These free oxygen radicals interfere with the new generation of the tissues by affecting DNA and breakage of the single bond and results in exaggerated postoperative inflammatory response that results in delayed wound healing and postoperative morbidities   including injuries to the heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, red blood cells, and muscles (4) . In normal conditions, free oxygen radicals are maintained at a low level by a varied system of enzymes involved in redox homeostasis in vivo. 
There are several biomarkers to measure oxidative stress such as the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynoneal (4-HNE), which are well-known biomarkers for lipid peroxidation (5). Additionally, enzymes that can eliminate ROS (e.g. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) can be measured. (6).
Of note, studies comparing the effects total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) to sevoflurane on the oxidant/antioxidant system are scarce (7).  

We hypothesized that, compared with sevoflurane, propofol-based anesthesia during radical mastectomy would be associated with less oxidative stress following radical mastectomy. The present study aimed to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on the expression of oxidative stress markers, malondialdehyde and the antioxidant; superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase following radical mastectomy.

Thus, we propose that the right drug, at the right dose, be given in the specific context like in diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. It would be strange and medically indefensible to empirically treat hypertension or diabetes without context-specific individualisation; so why so we do so for TB? This project is the first study of its kind to investigate the impact of rapid drug resistance profiling and tailored treatment on patient outcomes in a TB endemic country. We expect to show that sequencing-guided individualised therapy significantly reduces the time taken for patients to start effective therapy (at least 5 likely effective drugs). The timing is ripe to test this approach for detecting resistance as sequencers are now available in clinical laboratories (often for diseases like cancer), and bench top rapid sequencing is a reality (Illumina iSeq 100 and Oxford Nanopore devices). If this proof of concept trial demonstrates a significant impact on outcomes, then it will be a major driver for investment into molecular profiling to guide individualised therapy for DR-TB

Lymphedema is one of the most serious and predominant complication of breast cancer. Lymphedema changes functional abilities and may affect a patient’s psychosocial adjustment and overall quality of life and represents a complex therapeutic challenge for the physician. Problems associated with lymphedema include pain, feeling of discomfort and heaviness, difficulties with physical mobility, physiological distress, recurrent infections and social isolation which all negatively affect the quality of life of the patient
Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive condition. It is marked by an abnormal increase of tissue proteins, edema, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis caused by multiple factors related with lymphatic stasis, such as tumor lymph node infiltration, lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, trauma, and infection. 
Complex decongestive physical (CDP) therapy is known as an international standard approach for lymphedema treatment. These techniques include manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression bandaging, exercise, and skin care. The previous studies investigate mainly therapeutic effects of CDP therapy techniques on the changes of extremity size and lymphedema volume
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is often suggested in the field of physical treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema. IPC consists in the application of a force on an edema in order to evacuate its components as much as possible towards the physiological ways of drainage. 
Kinesiology Taping (KT) for lymphatic drainage is a new choice in the field of physical and alternative therapy. Development of the technique for its administration is still ongoing. Applying KT would have physiological effects including decreasing pain, supporting the movement of muscles, removing congestion of lymphatic fluid or hemorrhages under the skin, and correcting misalignment of joints.
Multi-layer bandaging is gradient compression suggests that the pressure over distal parts of the extremity has always to be higher than over proximal parts. By applying two or more layers of elastic material over each other the final bandage change its elastic property, becoming getting more inelastic (stiff) due to the friction between the layers. Bandaging may be very effective in aiding symptom control in patients with cancer-related lymphedema patients with complex medical problems. The compression therapy with low stretch bandages are used, which maintain the effects of the performed manual lymphatic drainage (MLD). Multi-layer bandaging is used during a period of intensive treatment it may also be used as part of long-term management in certain groups who cannot wear compression hosiery. Traditional approaches to multilayer bandaging use inelastic bandages over padding or foam layers

","Effect of Enhanced Recovery Protocol versus Conventional Protocol on Patients Outcome in Colorectal Surgeries
","Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent solid tumors in the Western world, and is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK. its incidence was estimated in the American cancer society about 1 in 21men and 1 in 23 women. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs are evidence-based protocols designed to standardize and optimize perioperative medical care in order to reduce surgical trauma, perioperative physiological stress and organ dysfunction related to elective procedures. In addition, improved outcomes, decreased hospital length of stay and faster patient recovery to normal life are expected to be obtained. So Enhanced recovery is a combination of elements of care for elective surgery which aims to: Optimize pre-operative preparation for surgery;  avoid iatrogenic problems such as postoperative ileus; minimize the stress response to surgery; speed recovery and return to normal function and recognize abnormal recovery and intervene if necessary. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of enhanced recovery protocol versus conventional protocol on patient’s outcome as regard postoperative insulin resistance, hospital stay and early oral intake in colorectal surgeries.

","No Adverse Events","Visual analogue scale (VAS): 
VAS was utilized for assessing and quantifying pain exhibited by the patients through a 0-10 cm scale. Each subject was informed to mark the line according to the pain intensity experienced at that particular time where ‘0’ means no pain and ‘10’ means worst conceivable pain.

Cervical ROM assessment:
Cervical range of motion device (CROM; Performance Attainment Associates) was used for assessment of neck lateral flexion and rotation of both sides.

Pressure pain threshold (PPT) assessment:
Pressure algometer (Somedic, Sales AB, Farsta, Sweden) was used for pressure pain threshold (PPT) assessment on the trigger spots

Statistical analysis:
Comparing of patient characteristics between groups was conducted by descriptive and t-test, while comparing of gender and affected side distribution was done by chi- squared test. Shapiro-Wilk test was applied for all variables for checking of normal data distribution. Homogeneity testing between groups was done by Levene’s test. Comparison of the treatment impacts on rotation and side bending ROM, VAS and PTT within and between the groups was done by Mixed MANOVA. Partial squared eta was deemed as the effect size. Post-hoc tests utilizing Bonferroni correction were used for subsequent various comparisons. Significant level of all measurable tests was set at p < 0.05.

"PACTR201905806116817","Cervical Cancer Screening Study","Clinical studies and in-depth interviews for portable, low-cost, and speculum-free cervical cancer screening in Ghana.","(i)  Background: Early screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions is a cost-effective strategy for reducing preventable mortality due to cervical cancer; however, coverage of cervical cancer screening programs remains inadequate in resource-limited settings, resulting in cancer progression and high mortality for women in such regions. Limitations to widespread coverage include expensive screening tools, loss of women to follow up, and fear of the speculum exam. To overcome some of the limitations with cervical cancer screening, we have developed the Callascope, a low-cost, speculum-free cervix imaging tool that can replace both the speculum and colposcope for more cost-effective and comfortable cervical cancer screening. The Callascope works with a mobile and computer-based application that can conveniently capture and store images of the cervix using a mobile phone, tablet or computer. 
 (ii) General Aim: This work seeks to pilot the Callascope in Ghana for widespread cervical cancer screening to determine endpoints of feasibility for clinical and community use, as well as patient and health provider acceptance. 
(iii) Methodology: There will be three main studies performed.  (1) Clinical studies in which a physician uses the Callascope with patients. Objectives: a) Feasibility of visualizing the cervix, b) Cervix area visualized compared to standard-of-care speculum, c) Diagnostic concordance compared to standard of care, d) Ease of use, e) Patient acceptability; (2) A volunteer study in which healthy volunteers use the Callascope for self-cervix imaging. Objectives: a) Feasibility of visualizing the cervix, b) Ease of use, c) Acceptability; and (3) in-depth interviews Objectives: Understand Knowledge and beliefs around reproductive health and cervical cancer, perceptions towards speculum and Callascope.

While the burden of infectious disease such as HIV/AIDS and TB epidemic still predominate in terms of both morbidity and mortality, there are now other emerging NCD epidemics. NCDs, mainly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes represent a leading threat to human health and development. The prevalence of these epidemics coincide with the rise in urbanization, industrialization, economic transition and health services that are not always adequately equipped to deal with the issues, more people are becoming ill and dying from the diseases. The broad aim of the project is to implement and evaluate a comprehensive CVD prevention programme in selected rural and semi-urban primary health care facilities in Capricorn District, South Africa.

"PACTR201907766143535","Ketorolac as an additive to bupivacaine in pectoral nerve block","Ketorolac as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in ultrasound guided pectoral nerve block (I+II) for patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy under general anaesthesia","Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is one of the optional surgical treatment of breast cancer. About 40 % of women have severe acute postoperative pain after MRM which is potentially disrupting the quality of postoperative recovery.  

Pectoral nerve block (PECS) is a safe and efficient peripheral nerve block that has been described recently. It allows intraoperative and postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing mastectomy. Additives to local anaesthetics improve the block efficacy and prolong its duration. 

Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that provides analgesia by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Parenteral and oral ketorolac become a popular alternative to opioids for postoperative pain.  

A systematic review on the use of local NSAIDs for non-ophthalmologic postoperative pain management concluded that Local NSAIDs provide analgesia in the postoperative period, it may reduce the amount of systemic NSAID and/or opioid analgesia used and adverse effects associated with local NSAID use are minimal and transient. 

So the aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of ketorolac as an additive to bupivacaine in pectoral nerve block (I+II) for management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing modified Radical mastectomy under general anesthesia.

Opioid free anaesthesia (OFA) reduces the need for postoperative opioids in the PACU, reduces postoperative hypertension and desaturation and improves the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the quality of recovery. There has been a move toward opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) to achieve the goals of hypnosis with amnesia and sympathetic stability without the adverse effects of opioids. Various methods as regional blocks and drugs such as lignocaine, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, etc., can be employed to preclude the use of opioids.) Studies have shown that when used in conjunction with general anaesthesia can reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirement  The aim of this study is to evaluate  the effect of opioid-free anaesthesia versus opioid-based anaesthesia in breast cancer patients, undergoing unilateral modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance, as regards:
•Pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in the first 24 hours postoperatively.
•Screening for post-mastectomy neuropathic pain.

"PACTR201910846018049","Mother-to-Mother Support Groups ","Impact of Mother-to-Mother Support Groups in Promoting Exclusive Breastfeeding in a Low-Resource Rural Community In Kenya: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Objective: To assess the impact of community-based Mother-to-Mother Support Groups (MTMSGs) with and without income generating activity (IGA) in promoting exclusive breastfeeding in low socioeconomic rural setting in Kenya.
Breastfeeding is the single most effective intervention for growth, health, development and survival of infants. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) provides infants with optimal nutrition requirements. Studies have demonstrated a number of short-term and long-term nutrition, health and socioeconomic benefits associated with breastfeeding. EBF protects infants against illnesses such as: respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, allergies, asthma, obesity and (human immune-deficiency virus) HIV infection. Mothers who exclusively breastfeed their infants have delayed onset of menstrual periods, have less risk of breast/ovarian cancers and experience better bonding with their infants. Early initiation to breastfeeding within one hour of birth, a critical indicator of EBF, saves 22% of infants from neonatal deaths. Recently, there has been improvement in the EBF rates in Kenya from 32% to 61 % (between 2009 and 2014). However, the country still has one of the lowest EBF rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. Community-based strategies improve the rates of EBF by increasing the length of maternal support before and after delivery. MTMSG is one of the strategies promoted by UNICEF worldwide for the improvement of infant young child feeding practices. In Kenya, there is paucity of information on the role of breastfeeding MTMSGs in improving infant and young child feeding despite the fact that the Ministry of Health (MoH), Kenya and UNICEF are promoting their use.

The major challenge has been the low rates of EBF globally (36%) despite the gradual increase in EBF rates in recent years. Prevalence of EBF is 32% and 18.6% in Kenya and Igembe District the study site, respectively. Mother-to-mother support groups (MTMSGs) is a strategy used in Kenya and other countries in the promotion of EBF. There is scarcity of data on the effectiveness of MTMSGs in promotion of EBF in Kenya. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of MTMSGs in promoting EBF in Igembe District, in Meru County, Kenya. The study adopted a cluster randomized controlled trial design in which 3 health centres were randomly allocated on a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 study groups; 2 treatment groups and one control group.  In one treatment group (MES), the mothers in the MTMSGs received education support whereas in the second treatment group (MESIGA) the mothers were engaged in an income generating activity in addition to receiving education support. In both groups, the mothers held 7 monthly meetings, one pre-natally and six post-natally. The mothers in the control group received no education support from the research team but followed the usual standard nutrition/health education at the health centre.  The sample sizes for each group were: MES 88; MESIGA 82; and the control group 79 mothers. The determination of infant feeding practices was done on a monthly basis from months 1 to 6. Observations of infant feeding practices were carried out on a10% of the study sample to verify maternal self-reported information at the interviews. Data on infant morbidity and weight measurements was collected on a monthly basis. Six focus group discussions were held to collect in-depth information on the rationale for maternal choices of infant feeding methods. The study outcome was EBF prevalence at 6 months as defined by cross-sectional data based on 24-hour recall and cumulative or continuous EBF. Data was analysed using SPSS software Version 17.0 and SAS 9.3 software. Mothers in MESIGA and MES were two times more likely to be exclusively breastfed at 6 months compared to mothers in Control Group {RR=2.42;CI(1.36-4.28);(p=0.004}and {RR=1.89; CI(1.02-3.49);(p=0.033)} respectively using cross-sectional 24-hr recall data. There was no significant difference between EBF rates at 6 months in MES and MESIGA. The median duration of cumulative EBF for the CG was significantly lower at 0.68 months as compared with MES at 2.8 months and MESIGA at 3.36 months (p=0.001). IGAs had significant (p<0.001) effect on rates of attendance to MTMSG meeting. The predictors of EBF were: not giving infants post-lacteal feeds (OR=0.17(0.05-0.55); (p=0.003)}, lack of infants’ illness {OR=0.27(0.12-0.63); (p=0.002) and receiving breastfeeding information from a health facility {OR=2.45(1.24-4.87); (p=0.010)}. The major barriers to EBF were: pressure from partners/relatives, cultural infant feeding practices such as giving of pre- and post-lacteal feeds, heavy maternal workload, and maternal separation from infants for long periods. The study findings show that MTMSGs, a community based intervention is an effective strategy in promoting EBF and should therefore be strengthened in the promotion of EBF programmes.

","Role of Health Education on Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake at Health Centers of Addis Ababa   

","Background: Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women in developing countries including Ethiopia. Despite its grave outcome, it can also be prevented if detected early. However, awareness about the illness in general and about its way of prevention and the availability of screening and treatment of the illness in specific is limited.  Hence, this study aims to determine the role of health education on cervical cancer screening uptake at the health centers of Addis Ababa.
 Methods: Two arm clustered randomized control trial was conducted at eight primary health centers that provide cervical cancer screening services using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screening method in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The eight selected health centers were stratified into two groups as intervention and non-intervention (four intervention and four control groups). Women aged 30-49 years who sought care from these government health centers at family planning, immunization services and children’s clinics (who are underage of five years) and who never screened for cervical cancer participated in the study. In the intervention health centers, all eligible women received a one-to-one brief health education and a brochure concerning cervical cancer in general and the benefits of cervical cancer screening.

Background: Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women in developing countries including Ethiopia. Despite its grave outcome, it can also be prevented if detected early. However, awareness about the illness in general and about its way of prevention and the availability of screening and treatment of the illness in specific is limited.  Hence, this study aims to determine the role of health education on cervical cancer screening uptake at the health centers of Addis Ababa.
 Methods: Two arm clustered randomized control trial was conducted at eight primary health centres that provide cervical cancer screening services using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screening method in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The eight selected health centers were stratified into two groups as intervention and non-intervention (four intervention and four control groups). Women aged 30-49 years who sought care from these government health centers at family planning, immunization services and children’s clinics (who are underage of five years) and who never screened for cervical cancer participated in the study. In the intervention health centers, all eligible women received a one-to-one brief health education and a brochure concerning cervical cancer in general and the benefits of cervical cancer screening.  After two months of time, following the initial data collection, follow-up data were collected to check whether they were screened for cervical cancer by a phone call. 
Result:  A total of 2,139 women participated in the study, 215 (10%) were screened for cervical cancer, where 151(70%) were from the intervention health centers. Seventy-four percent (74%) of screened women in the intervention health facilities reported that their awareness about the benefits of screening came from either the one to one health education or the print media. Women from the intervention health centers had higher odds of screening (AOR= 2.43,95%CI;1.58-2.90) than those from the control facilities. Women with a first degree or above were two times more likely to screen (AOR=2.03,95%CI;(1.15-2.58) than those who had no formal education. History of STI increased the odds of screening (AOR=1.55,95%CI;1.01-2.40).
Conclusion and Recommendation-Providing health education supported by printed educational materials in our case brochure increase the uptake of cervical cancer screening. We recommend integrating one-to-one health education and administering educational brochure about cervical cancer screening with the existing maternal health programs.

While oncogenesis initiates cancer modifier effects, exerted by the tissue microenvironment, guide progression. For instance, a wide variety of immune cells in the inflammatory microenvironment can contribute significantly to tumour suppression. Yet it is also evident that tumours can evolve tactics to ‘tilt’ the immune balance from being antagonistic to supportive (Prendergast et al., 2010). Thus, the balance between immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory signals in the inflammatory microenvironment has profound implications for tumour eradication, control (dormancy), or outgrowth. Currently, there is evidence of exercise-induced changes in the activity of macrophages, natural killer cells, lymphokine-activated killer cells, neutrophils, and regulating cytokines. These suggest that anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation may contribute to the protective value of exercise (Shepard & Shek, 1995; Duman et al., 2008,). Invariably, physical activity should also have implications in this context for surrogate markers of cancer prevention. Based on the above facts, it is proposed in this study that surrogate markers of cancer prevention may vary in patients with breast cancer compared to apparently healthy females who are age-matched, depending on their physical activity level; and that physically-active lifestyle modifications using pedometer will have the same effects in both groups. This study seeks to determine the effects of 6-week pedometer use on superoxide dismutase and body composition in patients with breast cancer and age-matched apparently healthy females.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Rehabilitation","","7/27/2016 12:00:00 AM","9/11/2016 12:00:00 AM","7/26/2018 12:00:00 AM","9/18/2019 12:00:00 AM","98","0","Completed","","True","Single Site","Cancer","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Outcome Assessors","Experimental Group; Control Group","Physical activity intervention; Usual activity","; ","Six weeks; Six weeks","The primary intervention comprised of 2 components delivered over a 6‐week period -

Personalized strategies from the goal-setting sessions included: enhancing motivation, overcoming barriers and developing appropriate walking plans. Goals were retained for one week to enable participants to reinforce their increased levels of walking or to try other strategies to successfully accumulate the additional steps. Participants were advised on the nature of the intensity and duration of the desired increases in walking. Participants were familiarized with the Borg 6–20 scale and advised that additional walking should be of a brisk nature that would leave them slightly breathless and hot, but still able to talk (indicated as between 12–14 on this scale). Bouts of at least 10 minutes in duration were advised for additional walking, although the accumulation of walking during everyday tasks as much as possible was also be advocated.

A Prospective, Randomized Double Blind Study","Comparison of Post Radical Mastectomy Analgesic Effect of PEC Block versus Wound Instillation through Surgical Drains with Bupivacaine. A Prospective, Randomized Double Blind Study.","Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Surgery is the main line of treatment of breast cancer either breast conserving surgery (BCS) or modified radical mastectomy. The management of postoperative pain is important for early mobilization and the well-being of surgical patients. In addition, optimal management of acute postoperative pain may influence the development of chronic pain.
A variety of local and regional techniques have been used to decrease the need for general anesthesia and to reduce postoperative opioid requirements: these have included local anesthetic infiltration, intercostal block, brachial block, thoracic epidural analgesia, and paravertebral block.

AIM OF WORK
.
The Primary outcome of this study is to compare the duration of analgesia resulting from local anesthetic installation into the wound through surgical drains versus regional PEC2 block in radical mastectomy.
The Secondary outcome is to compare the analgesic rescue frequency and total dose given in both groups as well as comparing the complications that might occur from each analgesic technique.

"PACTR201911530577414","Induced Food aversion technique; unpreceded intervention to treat obesity ","Induced Food aversion technique; unpreceded intervention to treat obesity ","Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI), a person’s weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of his or her height (in meters). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. A person with a BMI equal to or more than 25 is considered overweight (Organization, 2019).
	Obesity is a complex, multifactorial, and largely preventable disease, affecting, along with overweight, over a third of the world’s population today (Ng et al., 2014; Stevens et al., 2012).  If secular trends continue, by 2030 an estimated 38% of the world’s adult population will be overweight and another 20% will be obese. (Kelly, Yang, Chen, Reynolds & He, 2008).
In spite of the long list of interventions to manage obesity worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016 (Obesity and overweight, WHO 2018).  In Egypt, according to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Egypt has the highest percentage of obese adults worldwide. Around 19 million Egyptians, or 35 percent of the adult population, are obese; this is the highest rate across the globe.(Collaborators, 2017)
The morbidity effect of obesity is manifested in many body parts: brain (stroke); throat (sleep apnea, snoring); lungs (lung disease, asthma, pulmonary blood clots); heart (heart disease, diabetes, abnormal lipid profile, high blood pressure); liver (liver disease, fatty liver, cirrhosis); pancreas (pancreatitis); gall bladder (gallstones); uterus (female disorders, abnormal periods, infertility); knees (arthritis); calves (inflamed veins, often with blood clots); feet (gout); breast, uterus, colon, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, prostate (cancer) (CDC, 2019).

"PACTR202001518687696","Lung Recruitment During One Lung Ventilation","Effect of Stepwise Lung Recruitment Maneuver on Oxygenation, Lung Mechanics, Pulmonary Functions and Lung Injury Biomarkers During Lung Resection Surgery","Lung resection surgery is one of the most commonly performed thoracic surgical procedures; it could be wedge resection (non anatomic resection of partial lobe) or segmentectomy (anatomic resection of sublobar segment) or lobectomy (anatomic resection of entire lobe). Anaesthesia for lung resection routinely involves one-lung ventilation (OLV) to facilitate surgical exposure and to isolate and protect the lungs during the procedure.
Many pathophysiological consequences occur following lung resection surgery and one lung ventilation like hypoxia, atelectasis, obligatory intrapulmonary shunt, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and acute lung injury due to ventilator induced lung injury, prolonged OLV, re- expansion with ischemic reperfusion injury and poor postoperative predicted lung function. Lung protective ventilation and lung recruitment maneuvers are advocated during one lung ventilation (OLV) to lessen the degree of acute lung injury and to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.
Lung Recruitment Maneuver (LRM) is a sustained controlled increase in airway pressure for a certain time, with the goal to open collapsed alveoli, after which sufficient PEEP is applied to keep the lungs open. The goals of a recruitment maneuver are to serve as part of a lung protection strategy and to improve oxygenation, increase lung compliance and reduce ventilation-related lung injury and postoperative pulmonary complications in high-risk patients undergoing thoracic surgery.  Stepwise RM: pressure controlled ventilation is applied with constant
driving pressure with increasing PEEP.
The aim of this work is to study the effect of stepwise lung recruitment maneuver in patients undergoing lung resection surgery on oxygenation parameters primarily and on lung mechanics, pulmonary functions, lung injury biomarker, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and postoperative pulmonary complications secondarily.","RCT","Phase-2","","Treatment: Other","","12/1/2019 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","11/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","40","0","Not yet recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer; Respiratory; Surgery; Anaesthesia","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using by using procedures such as coin-tossing or dice-rolling","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Participants","Experimental Group; Control Group","stepwise lung recruitment ; Conventional volume controlled ventilation ","Step wise lung recruitment will be performed twice in Group (LR) lung recruitment group:

- Mechanical ventilation will be initiated using conventional volume controlled ventilation without lung recruitment.
","24 hours postoperatively; 24 hours postoperative","Stepwise lung recruitment maneuver:
- In this approach, lung recruitment maneuver will be performed with pressure controlled ventilation using incremental and decremental changes in PEEP with a constant driving pressure of 15 cmH2O, and balances recruitment maneuver against overdistension parameters.
- Maximum airway pressure (Pmax) will be increased to 38 cmH2O during recruitment with inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:2.
- PEEP will be increased in increments of 5 cm H2O for 3 respiratory cycles in a stepwise manner till reaching 20 cmH2O lasting for 6 respiratory cycles with a constant driving pressure of 15 cmH2O above the PEEP.

However, its efficacy is often limited by its related cardiotoxicity which may involve acute cardiotoxicity in the form of cardiac arrhythmia, pericarditis acute congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema.  Chronic cardiotoxicity  is more common and dangerous which may involve  cardiac failure, months or even years after the completion of treatment. 
Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is suggested to be through production of oxygen free radicals and highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite which induce apoptosis and cardiac myocytes damage as the heart is particularly poorly protected against oxidative stress.
Invito and animal studies revealed that omega 3 fatty acids may have protective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as it decreased oxidative stress and decrease myocardial injury caused by doxorubicin.

The aim of this study was to assess the possible protective effect of omega 3 fatty acid on doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Anemia is the most common extraintestinal
manifestation of IBD and can adversely affect quality of life. The pathophysiology of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease is multifactorial. The most obvious reason is gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss; however, sloughing of cells that line the GI tract, malabsorption and decrease in oral iron due to poor appetite can also contribute to iron deficiency anemia in IBD. In addition, the chronic inflammatory processes high hepcidin levels lead to inhibition of iron release from enterocytes decreased iron levels in the circulation and decrease its boiavailibility. Iron replacement include oral and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation are commonly used for treatment of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease, however oral iron supplementation frequently results in GI side effects, and theoretically, it may exacerbate IBD activity. Lactoferrin is a multifunctional protein and it has multiple biological roles as it is an antimicrobial protein and an immunostimulatory compound with anticancer agent and it also enhances iron absorption.
Aim of the work:
The aim of this study was to compare the effect of lactoferrin versus iron supplement in treatment of iron deficiency anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease.

The wide spread use of the ARV drugs has improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV and/ or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). As a result, there has been an increase in the prevalence of and mortality from non- AIDS complications such as non- AIDS defining cancers, liver, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. The increase in the non – AIDS complications especially the cardiovascular disease risk is linked to platelet and immune activation. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not completely abolish the immune activation and the platelet activation making it a necessity to find additional therapy to the conventional ART therapy that will decrease the occurrence of these non- AIDS complications and their associated morbidities. Aspirin or acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) has shown promise as such an additional drug. In addition, ASA appears to have an array of beneficial effects in the HIV infected individuals. ASA is reported to cause a reduction and maintenance in HIV load, significantly increase CD4 counts and halt the clinical HIV disease progression. Literature shows that additional therapy to ARV drugs may compromise adherence to ART among HIV- infected individuals. However, when addition of a pill is associated with significant benefit, the addition of a pill or pills may be justifiable. For example, addition of medication for opportunistic infection, methadone maintenance therapy and antidepressants has been reported to improve adherence to ART among HIV- infected patients in some studies. Therefore, considering the reported benefits of ASA in the HIV- infected population, it is important to study the effect of the addition of ASA on both the HIV disease progression and the adherence to ARV drugs.","RCT","Phase-2","","Treatment: Drugs","","2/17/2020 12:00:00 AM","3/2/2020 12:00:00 AM","2/17/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","454","0","Recruiting","","True","Multiple Sites Single Nation","Infections and Infestations","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Allocation was determined by the holder of the sequence who is situated off site","Masking/blinding used","Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors; Participants","Experimental Group; Control Group","Aspirin i.e. acetyl salicylic acid; placebo ","75 mg once daily for six months; one tablet of placebo for 75 mg aspirin taken once daily for six months","six months; six months","The participants who are the newly diagnosed HIV infected patients will be receiving 75 mg aspirin tablet once daily for six months in addition to their anti retroviral drugs.

"PACTR202002753354517","Impact of mobile technologies on cervical cancer screening practices in Lagos, Nigeria: A randomised controlled trial "mHealth-Cervix"","Impact of mobile technologies on cervical cancer screening practices in Lagos, Nigeria: A randomised controlled trial "mHealth-Cervix"","Cervical cancer is a major public health problem and is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide accounting for an estimated 570,000 new cases annually.[1] More than 80% of the global burden of cervical cancer occurs in the less developed regions, where it accounts for almost 12% of all female malignancies.[2,3] In 2018, an estimated 311,000 deaths were attributed to cervical cancer, which accounts for 7.5% of all female cancer deaths with 70% of these occurring in developing countries.[1] Early detection of precursor lesions of cervical cancer through the use of screening tests has drastically reduced the incidence of the disease especially in the Western countries where Pap smear (cytology) screening has been introduced and now covers almost all eligible women.[4] However, in the resource-constraint countries of the world such as Nigeria, cervical cancer incidence and mortality have remained high due to many obstacles facing the implementation of organized screening programs.[5] Use of mobile technologies has increased exponentially in the last few years.[7] We reported in a study conducted in 2018 that mobile telephones could be found in 95% of households in Lagos and were widely distributed across all socioeconomic classes.[8] Because of this technological explosion, mobile health (mHealth), or “medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices”,[9] has great potential in many health areas such as promotion and prevention.[10] There is limited evidence supporting mHealth technologies in cancer prevention and there is currently no reported randomized controlled trial in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) that examines the use of mobile health technologies in cancer prevention. This study will, therefore, aim to ascertain the efficacy of an intervention using mobile technologies on Pap smear screening adherence compared to a control condition and also determine the factors affecting the uptake of Pap smear screening services among women in Lagos.","RCT","Phase-3","","Early detection /Screening","","2/3/2020 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2020 12:00:00 AM","1/29/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/29/2021 12:00:00 AM","200","200","Active, not recruiting","","True","Multiple Sites Single Nation","Cancer","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors","Experimental Group; Control Group","mHealth messages; Usual care","Twice monthly; None","6 months; 6 months","Intervention (mHealth) arm – We chose Nexmo® as the platform to deliver the mHealth messages given its reliability and low cost.

The incidence of cervical cancer can be reduced by 80% only under the presence of an effective screening, access to cervical cancer services and improved follow up services (Morrison, 2015). The incidence rate of cervical cancer in Tanzania is 54 per 100,000 population (Kathleen et al, 2016), which is fifth highest in the world (Morrison, 2015). Despite the fact, cervical cancer screening (CCS) services are free of costs (Linde et al., 2019), the participation of women in CCS screened remains unsatisfactory in Tanzania as 6-21% of population (Runge et al., 2019). Knowledge deficit about the disease and screening remains a predominant factor for poor participation in CCS (Powell Pernga et al., 2013). Even though the government conducts public health education to promote awareness of cervical cancer screening aim to overcome the knowledge deficit Medical Women Association of Tanzania, 2018), the screening uptake remain unsatisfactory. This indicates the deficiency of the health education approach (in terms of content), deliverers, and beneficiaries, or it stipulates the presence of multiple screening hindrances that have not been successfully addressed by public health education (Moshi et al., 2018). Therefore, the new intervention approach should be adopted to address multiple screening hindrances. Peer-Led navigation (PLNav) is now widely applied to promote screening behaviour. Even though PLNav is an important approach to increase  CCS uptake, there is lack of studies in Tanzania concerning the utilization of this approach. This study aims to assess the effect of peer-led navigation (PLNav)  as a form of task shifting in promoting cervical cancer screening knowledge, intention, and practices among urban women in Tanzania.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Early detection /Screening","","3/20/2020 12:00:00 AM","3/27/2020 12:00:00 AM","9/20/2020 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2020 12:00:00 AM","88","88","Not yet recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer","","","Factorial: participants randomly allocated to either no, one, some or all interventions simultaneously","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors; Participants","Control Group; Experimental Group","Usual care; The Peer Led Navigation PLNav","Participants in control group will continue to receive usual care; One-time health education session will be delivered by community health workers.

"PACTR202004529189733","Health Education for Early Detection of ocular surface squamous neoplasia in Kenya.","Health Education for Early Detection of ocular surface squamous neoplasia in Kenya.","Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) is a tumour that grows on the conjunctiva and cornea. It is an important public eye health problem because it leads to blindness and even death. Africa has the highest incidence in the world equating to about 800 new cases annually in Kenya. Most patients are young (age 30s & 40s), 67% are women and 74% are living with HIV. About two thirds of OSSN patients living with HIV were enrolled in HIV care programs for antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests that the HIV care program may be a feasible intervention point to promote early detection and treatment of these tumours.

There is no OSSN screening program in place and no evidence that an early detection intervention through a health education and training programme is effective in reducing the delay in accessing treatment for OSSN. 

This study proposes to develop a health education tool for health workers and patients in comprehensive care clinics (CCC) and voluntary counselling centres (VCT) then evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in shortening the time it takes between noticing the tumour and visiting the eye clinic  by conducting a cluster randomized trial involving different HIV centres not including the development site .The primary outcome would be assessed 6 months later to compare the time taken between noticing the tumour and having an eye examination at an eye centre (time-to-referral).

The major enzyme involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen to endoxifen is CYP2D6. This enzyme exhibits extensive genetic variation which results in high inter-individual and inter-population differences in metabolism. It has been shown that people with no or reduced CYP2D6 activity will have poor response to tamoxifen. There is therefore a need to know whether genetic variation of CYP2D6*17 unique to African populations could explain why people of African descent have been reported to respond poorly to tamoxifen compared to their Caucasian counterparts. It will also be important to explore whether increasing the dose of tamoxifen for patients with CYP2D6*17/17 can result in therapeutic levels of the active metabolite endoxifen. the main objective of the study is to determine the effect of the African specific CYP2D6*17 genetic variant in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics and formation of its metabolites in healthy volunteers.","CCT","Phase-1","PHAT","Treatment: Drugs","","1/7/2019 12:00:00 AM","4/22/2019 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","42","0","Recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer","A2386; CT1702018","Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe; Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Non-randomised","","","","Allocation was determined by the holder of the sequence who is situated off site","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Control Group; Experimental Group; Experimental Group","Tamoxifen; Tamoxifen ; Tamoxifen","20mg, single dose p.o; 20 mg as a single dose; 20 mg as a single dose","1 day; 1 day; 1 day","Tamoxifen 20mg tablet single dose normal CYP2D6 activity *1/*1 diplotype; Tamoxifen 20mg given as a single dose to participants with genotype CYP2D6*1/*17 enzyme; Tamoxifen 20mg given as a single dose to participants with genotype CYP2D6*17/*17 enzyme","14; 14; 14","Active-Treatment of Control Group; ; ","Male and female subjects aged 18 to 30 years (inclusive).

Carcinoma of the cervix is the most prevalent gynaecological malignancy in this environment, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Papanicolaou test is a well-recognised and efficient screening modality but the uptake of Pap smear in our environment remains poor. Fear of pain from speculum insertion during vaginal examination has been noted as a factor that may reduce the compliance of women to cervical cancer screening and repeat testing. Speculum lubrication may help to reduce these pain and discomfort, but there are fears of its interference with cytological results. 

Aim and Objectives: 
To determine and compare adequacy of cervical cytology smears and mean pain scores of women undergoing cervical screening with or without speculum lubrication.

Research Methodology: 
This proposed work will be a randomized controlled study among women having cervical cancer screening at the gynaecological clinic of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi. Sixty-six patients would be  randomly assigned to the ‘Gel group’ and another 66 patients to the ‘No Gel’ group. Samples will be collected from each participant for Pap smear with lubricated vaginal speculum for the ‘Gel group’ and non-lubricated vaginal speculum for the ‘No Gel group’. Pain scores will be assessed with the numeric rating scale for pain. The primary outcome measures will be the mean numeric rating scale pain scores and proportion of women with inadequate cervical cytology smears.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Early detection /Screening","","7/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2020 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","132","0","Not yet recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer; Pregnancy and Childbirth; Urological and Genital Diseases; Obstetrics and Gynecology","","","Factorial: participants randomly allocated to either no, one, some or all interventions simultaneously","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Outcome Assessors","Experimental Group; Control Group","Speculum Lubricated with Water Soluble Gel; Speculum Without Lubrication","Once; Once","10 minutes; 10 Minutes","During vaginal examination, the speculum to be used will be lubricated with water soluble gel to ease insertion .; During vaginal examination, the speculum to be used will not be lubricated.","66; 66","; Historical","The participants will include pre and post-menopausal women who require Pap smear.","The following women would be excluded from the work virgins, pregnant women, women having their menstrual period, women with any overt cervical pathology, women with vulvar pathologies or those on hormone replacement therapy.

This reflects the World Health Organization's predictions that there will be a significant increase in the incidence and mortality of cancer in low and middle-income countries. Despite advances in cancer management, most African societies remain poorly prepared to cope with endemic cancer. For instance, Nigeria, the largest country in Africa with a population of about 200 million, has limited capacity to treat cancer due to inadequate/inaccessible medical facilities, corruption, lack of infrastructure and qualified personnel. Though, a variety of psychosocial interventions have been used to assist adults living with cancer and family caregivers in managing the effects of cancer and caregiving on QoL. These were mainly investigated in high-income countries, with no published studies coming from Africa, or Nigeria in particular
The primary aim is to test the feasibility indicators (i.e. eligibility rate, recruitment rate, attrition rate, adherence, number of adverse events, ratings of burden and acceptability) of a psychosocial intervention to be delivered in the first three months of diagnosis that addresses the psychosocial needs of adults living with cancer and their family caregivers. The secondary aim is to evaluate if the intervention was useful in improving the QoL of adults living with cancer and their family caregivers.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Other Interventions","Socio-spiritual intervention","10/5/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/21/2020 12:00:00 AM","5/26/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","152","0","Not yet recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer","","","Factorial: participants randomly allocated to either no, one, some or all interventions simultaneously","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors; Participants","Experimental Group; Control Group; Control Group","a sociospiritual intervention; Nil; Usual care ","Four weekly face-to-face sessions lasting 120 minutes; The control group of the study will receive the usual care (standard medical treatment and other appointments).; The control group of the study will receive the usual care (standard medical treatment and other appointments)","120 minutes ; Nil; Nil","A 4-week plan including face-to-face training, video coaching sessions and counselling will be implemented for adults living with cancer and their family caregivers in the intervention group.

These factors encompass adult with cancer-family caregiver dyadic (i) family/social support, (ii) spiritual support, (iii) interpersonal communication and relationships and (iv) cancer health literacy (see Table 1). The intervention will be delivered to patient-caregiver pairs (dyads) in a group format of five to seven dyads. Two groups will be running on the same schedule but on different days of the week. The total program for all participants will be delivered over four months. Group sessions will provide opportunities to express feelings and discuss issues of shared concern. For example, discussions will enable participants to gain an understanding of their experiences and how these may have changed their view of life, guiding them to adopt an optimistic cognitive framework for coping with stress and finding benefits in their situation. 
A room at the hospital will be used for group sessions.

A prospective randomized study","Opioid-free general anesthesia for Transthoracic Oesophagectomy; Does it improve postoperative analgesia and other recovery criteria? A prospective randomized study","A transthoracic oesophagectomy, also known as an Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy, is a procedure in which part of the esophagus is removed. Through an abdominal incision and a right thoracotomy incision. The cancerous portion of the esophagus is removed, along with the surrounding lymph nodes and a small margin of healthy tissue above and below the tumor. The stomach is made into a cylinder, pulled up into the chest and connected to the remaining section of the esophagus. Although esophageal cancer is a highly fatal cancer, with the sixth highest cancer-related mortality rate [1]
Research data on esophageal cancer is limited compared to that of other cancers. [2] Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), an important care pathway to effectively facilitate early recovery in postoperative patients, has short-term benefits including reduced hospital stay after esophageal cancer surgery. Two key components of ERAS are the maintenance of effective pain control while reducing excessive opioid use and a reduction of postoperative complications. [3,4]
Recent findings from retrospective clinical trials, as well as experimental studies strongly suggest that opioids may inhibit cellular immunity through their effects on natural killer cell activity, stimulate angiogenesis and accentuate cancer cell growth. Hence, perioperative use of opioids might affect long-term oncological outcomes in the cancer surgical patients. This explains the current trend to use non-opioid drugs as an alternative to opioids for pain management during the perioperative period. [5] Postoperative opioid use and postoperative complications after esophageal cancer are closely related because opioid use itself may cause postoperative complications, and patients with postoperative complications generally require more opioids. [6, 7] 
Opioid-Free Anaesthesia (OFA) is a procedure that avoids opioid use during anaesthesia. A combination of several drugs including alpha-2-agonist, low-dose of N-Methyl-D-Asparate (NMDA) antagonist and lidocaine are added to usual hypnotic drug. Modulating peripheral afferent noxious stimulation, these agents may potentiate analgesic effects of opioid. (8)
        The primary goal of this study will be assessment of the effectiveness of OFA in transthoracic oesophagectomy in comparison with opioid-based technique (OBA) regarding the postoperative pain profile assessed by the visual analogue score (VAS) for 6 hours. Our secondary goal is to compare between patients of both techniques regarding postoperative breathing profile (respiratory rate, O2 saturation and arterial blood gases), the incidence of postoperative complications (e.g nausea, vomiting and shivering), the incidence of postoperative agitation in addition to patient hemodynamics immediately post-extubation and for the next 6 hours.

","The effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy integrated with Activity Pacing (CBT-AP) on cancer related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: A randomized clinical trial ","Globally, cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, that account an estimated 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million number of death in 2018. In Africa, there were 847,000 new cancer cases and 591,000 deaths in Africa in 2012. In 2014, World Health Organization (WHO) had reported approximately 60,000 new cancer cases are diagnosed annually in Ethiopia. However, limited capacity to detect, lack of awareness of the people about early detection and management affect the prevention and control of cancer. Fatigue is one of the most common problems of cancer patients. Sometimes fatigue may cause depression, nausea, vomiting, or pain(World health organization, 2020). Persistent cancer related fatigue affects the functional status and quality of life of cancer patients(National comprehensive cancer Network, 2018). Fatigue was found to be the most common symptom scale among breast cancer patients in Ethiopia. Fatigue is one of the major factor that influence the Quality of life of breast cancer patients in Ethiopia. It has been shown that quality of life assessment is helpful to predict treatment response and to identify common problems and their interventions in cancer patients that could contribute to improve treatment and could be a prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. Therefore, Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to manage cancer related fatigue and improve Quality of Life of breast cancer patients. Many studies reported the effectiveness of CBT-AP on cancer related fatigue, and Quality of Life. The objective of the study is to assess the effect of CBT-AP on cancer-related fatigue and Quality of Life among breast cancer patients in Ethiopia.

IPT is a brief manualized Psychotherapy that has been adapted for low-income countries including Ethiopia through a series of trials that demonstrated its relevance and efficacy across cultures (30-36). It is recommended in international consensus treatment guidelines for depression. It also helps patients who struggle with psychological distress and psychiatric symptoms of common mental health disorders (CMDs) which consists of depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders or medically unexplained symptoms. IPT is believed to be helpful for these disorders or disturbances in the context of stressful relationships where there is loss and bereavement, role transitions, and life changes or disagreements and disputes.
As per the IPT-E guideline, the therapeutic process consists of the beginning phase, middle phase, and that of the final phase. IPT-E session consists of a total of 4-8 sessions. However, in this study, the intervention involved 4-6 therapy sessions.
BEGINNING TASKS:
At the beginning (1st session) the therapist asked the patients questions that help to understand their problems, symptoms, explanatory model, and psychosocial supports. Here therapeutic relationship, provision of feedback, and identification of IPT problem areas (loss, change, or disagreements) were established for the focus of the middle phase sessions.
MIDDLE PHASE TASKS: In this phase (2nd and 3rd sessions) the therapist was working through aspects of underlying interpersonal problems and helping patients to connect with supports. Even though it is recommended to focus on one problem area, the therapist sometimes can extend the therapeutic focus to other areas when it is believed to be saliently linked to current distress.

The primary outcomes were level of depression and anxiety. It was measured using Ethiopian validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression measurement scale (HADS) which showed good consistency between the items and high test-retest reliability. HADS is a widely used health-related quality of life instrument for measuring psychological distress in non-psychiatric patients. The items are rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3 giving maximum and minimum scores of 0 and 21 respectively for each subscale. Sub-scores on the anxiety or depression sub-scales ranging from 0 to 7 are considered normal; while 8 to 10 and 11 to 21 are considered to cause for concern’ and ‘probable cases of anxiety or depression’ respectively.
The interpretation of HADS measurement   scale is as follows:-
•	0 to 7--- normal
•	8 to 10----- mild
•	11 to 14 ----- moderate   and 
•	15 to 21----- severe.
; The secondary outcome of this study was the quality of life. It was assessed using the Amharic version of EORTC QLQ-C30 that is found to be reliable and had an acceptable validity to assess the QOL among cancer patients. The questionnaires have 30 items with three scales and 15 different domains. The three scales used were functional, symptom scale, and general health status as a separate scale. Domains such as physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning under functional scale whereas dyspnea, pain, fatigue, insomnia, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea as well as financial difficulties under symptom scale and general health status as a separate scale. 
The scoring was done according to the Quality of life questionnaire-C30 manual. According to the manual, the quality of life questionnaire version-3 has 30 item questions to assess the quality of life of cancer patients in general. So after the patients' response was taken carefully using questions ranging from Item 1(I1to Item 30 (Iзȯ), the raw score was calculated and further be used for each scales (Functional, symptom and general health status), then linear transformation were undertaken for each domain under the subsequent scales. 
This raw score was further be used for each scale (Functional, symptom, and general health status), then linear transformation was undertaken for each domain under the subsequent scales.

 The linear transformation from 0-100 was applied to obtain the score S, the individual score for each domain. The linear transformation was done to use individual scores for the subsequent analysis. The formula written below was used for functional, symptom scale, and general status.

"PACTR202012742050337","Comparison between clarithromycin and levofloxacin in treatment of H pylori","Levofloxacin-based  versus Clarithromycin-based triple therapy for Treatment of Helicobacter pylori","Background: Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of gastritis, non-ulcer dyspepsia, peptic ulcer diseases and gastric cancer ( Fuccio etal.,2009). Eradication of H pylori can lead to reduction in the recurrence of peptic ulcer diseases and prevention of gastric cancer, and has been recommended in several consensus conferences (Talleyetal.,2008) .
One of the most commonly used first-line regimens is clarithromycin-based triple therapy for 7-14 days  ( Chey & Wong , 2007 ) . With the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to clarithromycin, the eradication rate with standard first-line treatment has fallen to <80% in many countries (Graham &Shiotani , 2006 ) .
Therefore, several alternative first-line regimens, including levofloxacin-based treatment and sequential treatment, have been proposed . Levofloxacin-based triple therapy have been shown to be effective as the second-line and third-line rescue regimens for those who failed standard treatment, with an eradication rate ranging from 75 to 90% ( Lee et al., 2006).
 Recent studies have also shown that levofloxacin-based triple therapy is as effective as the first-line treatment. Nista et al,2006  reported that triple therapy comprising levofloxacin, clarithromycin and esomeprazole for 7 days achieved a higher eradication rate (87%) than clarithromycin-based triple therapy comprising clarithromycin, esomeprazole and either amoxicillin (75%) or metronidazole (72%) ( Nista  et al.,2006 ) .

However, validation of the efficacy of levofloxacin-based treatment as the first-line treatment is required before its clinical application in different countries. 
Aim: To evaluate two regimens of therapy for H pylori namely 
 ( Levofloxacin, amoxicillin and esomeprazol ) and (Clarithromycin, amoxicillin and esomeprazol) regarding the safety and efficacy as a first line treatment of H.pylori .

"PACTR202101898000346","Improving opioid analgesics use in Cancer by using media tools addressing selected barriers.","Feasibility and Outcomes of a Media-based Intervention Against Attitudinal Barriers of Cancer Patients and their Family Caregivers Towards Opioid Analgesics Use. ","Pain Prevalence is high in cancer patients, and it increases with disease progression or metastasis. Pain could negatively affect patients' mental and daily life activities including administration of Opioid analgesics. Thus, a patient might depend on a family care giver's assistance to use Opioids for pain. 
Many society, family, and patient-related barriers are reported in literature to be contributing to under-treatment of pain by Opioid analgesics. If Cancer patients &/or their family care givers had an attitudinal barrier like fear of addiction resulting from the Opioid, it may be more probable that these individuals might somehow withhold their medication without physician's recommendation.
Fortunately, certain negative barriers towards Opioid analgesics were enhanced after brief education provided during a trial. This short session was held in clinics, and addressed Cancer patients and their family carers via both written and video-based media. Our trial aims to study feasibility of educating participating Egyptian cancer patients and their family care givers, in the city of Alexandria, via one of two different pre-designed media tools (video/written). Our second goal will be to compare outcomes of education in terms of participants' attitudinal barriers and reported practices of using Opioids, as well as patients' pain level.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Education /Training","","1/31/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","3/14/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","104","0","Recruiting","","True","Multiple Sites Single Nation","Cancer","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Permuted block randomization","","4 fixed","Allocation was determined by the holder of the sequence who is situated off site","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Experimental Group; Control Group","Innovative promotion; Traditional promotion","At least single exposure during the first session.

Perioperative factors such as anesthesia, analgesia, blood transfusion and temperature control could all interact with and impact on the surgical outcome. Among them, one of the main modifiable factors in anesthesia is the choice of volatile anesthetics or intravenous anesthetic for the maintenance of general anesthesia[4,5]. 
While total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol has a slightly higher risk of intraoperative awareness and intraoperative hypotension, it also allows for faster emergence, reduced risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting[6,7]. In addition, more recent studies suggest that propofol may have some anti-tumor properties. In contrast, volatile anesthetics (VA) such as isoflurane and sevoflurane have been reported to promote the proliferation and migration of various cancer cell lines in vitro, and increase the tumor load in vivo. It therefore stands to reason that propofol TIVA may reduce cancer cell dissemination during surgery, reduce cancer recurrence and increase patient survival. In the past few years, several studies have compared long-term outcomes of patients operated with inhalational anesthesia and TIVA and reported varying degrees of success with TIVA[8–10].
This prospective randomised study aims to evaluate the effect of propofol bases TIVA on cancer patent outcome after colorectal surgeries regarding the tumor free survival, 1-year survival, cancer recurrence.","RCT","Not Applicable","TIVA in colorectal cancer","Prevention","","3/10/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","3/10/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","200","0","Recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer; Anaesthesia","R.21.01.1166 ","Institutional Research Board-Mansoura university","Factorial: participants randomly allocated to either no, one, some or all interventions simultaneously","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Masking/blinding used","Care giver/Provider; Outcome Assessors; Participants","Control Group; Experimental Group","I group; Group T","; ","Patients will be followed up for 1 year after surgery; Patients will be followed up for 1 year","Standard monitoring will be used.

The ablative treatment methods include cryotherapy, thermal ablation and laser. The excision treatment procedures include loop electrosurgical excision procedure, laser and cold knife. The WHO has recently recommended thermal ablation for the treatment of cervical premalignant lesions. However, there are still a few unresolved issues around the technique. The duration of application of the probe on the cervix varies from 20 to 60 seconds in various studies. The Scottish studies that till date have documented the best cure rate with thermal ablation used only 20 seconds for each application. However, the studies conducted by IARC have used 30 seconds or 45 seconds for each application. No anaesthesia is used for the procedure. At least a few (<5%) women complain of moderate to severe pain during the procedure. No study has evaluated whether the pain can be reduced by simple local anaesthetic spray.
The objectives of the trial are:
- To study the feasibility, acceptability, safety, clinical utility and effectiveness of thermal ablation for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) at Parirenyatwa Central Hospital in Zimbabwe. 
- To compare the intensity of pain during thermal ablation after application of local anaesthesia using lidocaine local spray with that without local anaesthesia.

All these techniques have their merits and demerits. 
Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a newer technique of regional anesthesia to the chest wall, where local anesthetic is deposited between the transverse process and erector spinae muscle resulting in analgesia to the hemithorax. 
Aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block using 0.25% bupivacaine versus conventional multimodal intravenous analgesia on postoperative pain control after conserving surgery for breast cancer

A randomised pilot trial ","Does hair curl variation influence the efficacy of scalp cooling in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia in breast cancer patients? A randomised pilot trial ","Background
Chemotherapeutic agents are commonly administered as a treatment for breast cancer. They work by damaging rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells with an unintended effect on other normal cells such as hair follicles, which may result in alopecia. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA), although reversible, has been described as one of the most common and distressing side effects of cancer therapy, affecting approximately 65% of all patients and influencing treatment decisions in some women who want to avoid hair loss.  Scalp cooling devices have been proven effective in reducing CIA. However, It is not clear from published literature, results of which are derived mainly from patients with straight hair, whether these results are generalisable to patients with curlier hair types. Results of a Dutch scalp cooling registry comprising of 1411 patients showed this intervention to be effective in 50% of patients.  Although a multivariate analysis failed to show that hair type had an impact on efficacy, it is noteworthy that patients with ‘African hair’ type constituted only 1% of the registry. In a randomised prospective clinical study, the Scalp Cooling Alopecia Prevention (SCALP) trial, the cooling system was significantly more likely to cause less hair loss. In this trial, although no multivariate analysis by hair type is stipulated, demographic information shows that only 12% of the study population was Black or African American. In another prospective study, the use of scalp cooling was associated with less hair loss after chemotherapy. In this study, as with previous trials, Black women constituted a minority of the study population with only 10.4% representation.

In this pilot trial, the research aims were to assess feasibility of conducting a definitive trial  and to evaluate whether hair curvature influences the ability of scalp cooling to reduce chemotherapy-induced hair loss in breast cancer patients.

","A Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, Multicenter Study Evaluating The Efficacy And Safety Of Adjuvant Giredestrant Compared With Physician's Choice Of Adjuvant Endocrine Monotherapy In Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Early Breast Cancer

","Study Rationale 
Endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs [with or without ovarian function suppression (OFS)]) are currently the main endocrine treatment options for estrogen receptor- positive (ER+) early breast cancer (EBC). Despite the effectiveness of available therapies, many patients ultimately experience disease relapse or develop resistance to these agents. In addition, treatment-associated toxicity is an important major barrier to the full application of the current cancer treatment leading to treatment discontinuation in many patients. Consequently, there is a critical need for more optimal adjuvant therapy in patients with ER+ EBC, particularly for patients who have a high likelihood of recurrence. 

Objectives and Endpoints and Estimands 
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of giredestrant compared with Endocrine Therapy of Physician's Choice (TPC) in participants with ER+ HER2- EBC who have completed (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and have had surgery.

Participants who are capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the Informed Consent Form and in this protocol 
• Participants (females, regardless of menopausal status, and males) who are age greater or equal to 18 years at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form
 • Participants who have documented ER positive tumor by immunohistochemistry, as assessed locally on a primary disease specimen and defined as greater or equal to 1percent of tumor cells stained positive according to the ASCO/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines (Allison et al. 2020).
 • Participants who have documented HER2 negative tumor, as assessed locally on a primary disease specimen and defined according to ASCO/CAP guidelines (Wolff et al. 2018) 
• Participants who have multicentric (the presence of two of more tumor foci within different quadrants of the same breast) and/or multifocal (the presence of two or more tumor foci within a single quadrant of the breast) breast cancer are also eligible if all examined tumors meet pathologic criteria for ER positivity and HER2 negativity
- Participants with bilateral synchronous invasive breast cancer are eligible if all histopathologically examined tumors meet pathologic criteria for ER positivity and HER2 negativity
•	Participants must have undergone definitive surgery of the primary breast tumor(s). With the exception of the situations described below, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and/or a component of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional excisions may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the participant must undergo mastectomy to be eligible. Of note, participants with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.
– For participants who undergo mastectomy or wide local excision where deep margin abuts the pectoralis fascia, participants with microscopic positive margins are eligible as long as radiotherapy of the chest wall is administered prior to study entry. Participants with positive anterior margins may be eligible if there is no gross disease left behind (radiotherapy as per local guidelines). 
– Participants with suspected metastasis in supraclavicular or internal mammary nodes should be treated in accordance with standard local guidelines. 
– If given, radiation therapy (e.g., post-mastectomy or post-lumpectomy) should be administered according to standard guidelines.
 • Participants who received or will be receiving adjuvant chemotherapy must have completed adjuvant chemotherapy prior to randomization. Participants may also have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last adjuvant chemotherapy dose and randomization.
 – Participants who are not candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy or decline chemotherapy are permitted.
Participants for whom resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy or surgical procedures to NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade 1 or better (except alopecia, Grade less than or equal to 2 peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the participant per the investigator’s judgment) • Participants have received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and/or had surgery and had no prior endocrine therapy are eligible, provided that they are enrolled within 12 months following definitive breast cancer surgery • Participants who have confirmed availability of an untreated primary breast tumor tissue specimen suitable for biomarker testing (i.e., representative archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue block [preferred] or 1520 slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial sections), with associated de-identified pathology report is required. Although 1520 slides are preferred, if only 1014 slides are available, the individual may still be eligible for the study. – For eligibility determination on the basis of Ki67 score, a breast tumor tissue sample obtained prior to any exposure to systemic therapy must be submitted during screening for testing by a central pathology laboratory (see Section 8.7 for details on tumor tissue requirements)

Participants who received adjuvant chemotherapy or no chemotherapy must have the following:

For participants receiving heparin, PTT (or aPTT) between 1.5 and 2.5 ULN (or a participant’s value prior to starting heparin treatment) is required. 
If anticoagulation therapy is required for a prosthetic heart valve, stable INR between 2.5 and 3.5 is permitted.

For women of childbearing potential: participants who agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception (women assigned to tamoxifen must also agree to refrain from donating eggs), as defined below: 
Women must remain abstinent or use non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1percent per year during the treatment period and for 9 days after the final dose of giredestrant or within the time period specified per local prescribing guidelines after the final dose of TPC (i.e., 60 days after the final dose of tamoxifenwomen must refrain from donating eggs during this same period; 21 days after the final dose of letrozole or anastrozole; 30 days after the final dose of exemestane).
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (greater or equal to 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations. Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1percent  per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the individual. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists are not adequate contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.

For men assigned: participants who agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: 
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 9 days after the final dose of giredestrant within the time period specified per local prescribing guidelines after the final dose of TPC (i.e., 90 days after the final dose of tamoxifen; 21 days after the final dose of letrozole or anastrozole; 30 days after the final dose of exemestane) to avoid exposing the embryo. 
Additionally, for men receiving tamoxifen with female partners of childbearing potential, highly effective contraception should be used during treatment and for 90 days after final dose due to genotoxicity. Highly effective contraception may include vasectomy, abstinence, hormonal contraception in partner, bilateral tubal ligation in partner, or intrauterine device in partner. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the individual. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure. If required per local guidelines or regulations, information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.

","
The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to a cluster of respiratory illnesses, collectively called COVID-19, similar to those caused by SARS-CoV. COVID-19 has been associated with a high transmission rate, and severe cases require admission to hospital intensive care units with the need for mechanical ventilation and associated high mortality. 
International health authorities suggest that individuals aged 65 years and above and people with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and immunosuppressed medical conditions, including HIV infection, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19.
Persons living with diagnosed HIV experienced poorer COVID-related outcomes relative to persons living without diagnosed HIV; previous HIV diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization, and hospitalization risk increased with progression of HIV disease stage.
The authorized or licensed vaccines and most vaccine candidates in development are focused on the major antigenic target of the virus, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein.
SCB-2019 is a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-Trimer protein fused to Trimer-Tag© produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Trimer-Tag© is derived from the fully-human C-propeptide domain of pro-collagen.
Immunogenicity and safety of different dose levels (3, 9, and 30 µg) of SCB-2019 vaccine, administered standalone and with CpG 1018 and Aluminum hydroxide (CpG/Alum) and AS03 adjuvant systems were assessed in Phase 1 clinical study. All tested formulations were well-tolerated and induced neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A 30 µg of SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum adjuvant was selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 program as having a favorable benefit/risk profile.
The ongoing pivotal Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical study (CLO-SCB-2019-003) has recruited at least 26,000 healthy adolescent and adult participants and individuals with stable pre-existing stable chronic medical conditions, including HIV infection. However, this study does not explicitly describe the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety in participants with HIV infection.
HIV infection is known to impact immune response to several vaccines. However, use of ART treatment in this population allowed to achieve adequate and protective immune responses to many vaccines. This includes vaccines using a toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) agonist as adjuvant which are known to have a potential impact on HIV infection parameters (e.g. CD4+ T-cell count, ribonucleic acid [RNA] viral load). 
In addition, recent data on authorized or licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines indicates that extending the interval between the first and second dose is associated with a higher vaccine efficacy. In the current pandemic situation where access to doses is under pressure, flexibility regarding the interval between doses is important.
 
The summarized objectives of this study are: to describe immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of the SCB-2019 vaccine in both participants with HIV infection and healthy participants, who received 2-dose vaccination series 3 or 6 weeks apart, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers, 21 days after second vaccination with SCB-2019. In HIV infected subjects, immunogenicity will also be analyzed by baseline CD4+ T-cell count and RNA viral load. In addition, changes in CD4+ T-cell count and HIV RNA viral load compared to baseline are also to be evaluated.

As a consequence, a clear decrease of its harmful effects such as lung cancer has been noted, particularly in developed countries.   
Nevertheless, tobacco use remains a major public health problem especially in developing countries and emerging economies. 
Health structures countermeasure-procedures prove to be unsatisfying. Therefore, many innovative strategies have been designed and put into test to enhance patient motivation toward tobacco cessation. Motivation is where the biggest challenge of smoking cessation prevails, therefore medical institutions and teams are constantly developing tools to enhance patient motivation toward cessation mainly through a presentation of the adverse effects of smoking versus the benefits if quitting and assistance during the quitting procedure. Many tools can be involved in this approach: motivational advice and interviewing, family assisted approaches, complimentary screening, and the development of mobile applications. Lung health monitoring is an objective way to explicitly show smoking adverse effect on health status. By emphasizing measurable effects of tobacco on lungs we may turning patient attention to the importance of quitting and enhance his motivation toward cessation. In fact, many interventions have been adopted to tackle this highly challenging issue, among them was pulmonary function test (PFT) or spirometry including lung age determination and communication, yet recent reviews have shown significantly controversial results [6] [7].
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of announcing spirometry results and lung age on smoking cessation among patients attending the smoking cessation clinic (SCC) of Monastir.

Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a complex disorder associated with MRM which limits the normal functionality and affect the overall quality of life. (Fecho et al., 2009)The incidence of chronic pain after mastectomy is as high as 25–60%. (Andresen et al., 2011)With the introduction of ultrasound technology into regional anesthesia and pain management routines, the popularity of interfascial plane blocks has increased. (Chin et al., 2019)
 Based on the origin, alignment, branches, and distribution of the intercostal nerves within the anterior thoracic region, postoperative analgesia in breast cancer patients can be done by different nerve blocks as apart of multimodal analgesia.This study aims to compare and evaluate the differences between the two combined techniques: pectoral nerve block with Pectointercoastal fascial plane block and erector spinae plane block with Pectointercoastal fascial plane block as regard the analgesic profile in modified radical mastectomy.Pectoral nerve (PECS) block is an interfascial plane block with reported analgesic efficacy following mastectomy. (Blanco R., 2011). PECS I involves injection of local anesthetics in the tissue plane situated between the pectoralis major and minor muscles. PECS II is an extension of PECS I, with placement of additional local anesthetic between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscle (SAM). (Blanco et al., 2012)Pectointercostal fascial plane block (PIFPB) targets the anterior cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve (Lopez-Matamala et al., 2014)The erector spinae plane (ESP) block is simple and safe technique alternative to paravertebral block. (Ueshima et al., 2017)
It involves injection of local anesthetic into the musculofascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscle and superficial to the tips of the transverse processes. (Voscopoulos et al., 2013)

However, the workup of such specimens is often challenging. To address these barriers to diagnosis, Aikili Biosystems seeks to enable the same-day diagnostic profiling of breast cancer at the point-of-care using a low-cost, automated system. Building upon initial development and successful clinical validation of human
samples, the goal of this study is to further validate the Aikili technology for use in automated immunohistochemical workup. Specifically, we propose to evaluate the performance of our system to reliably detect breast cancer receptor and HER2 status in
human FNAs compared to accepted gold standards (n=40).

It has been noted to have significant immunomodulatory effects acting on the cells of the innate immunity. Its’ deficiency has emerged as a global health concern. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with deteriorating bone health and in severe cases hypocalcemia with subsequent development of rickets and osteomalacia in both children and adults. It has also been associated with increased incidence of cancer, cardiovascular mortality and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of these conditions. Oral and intramuscular routes of administration have been used for the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

"PACTR202201864472288","Breast cancer detection by dog sniffing in Tunisia","Transcutaneous canine breast cancer detection in Tunisia ","Breast cancer is a public health problem in Tunisia due to its frequency and severity. The  late diagnosis of breast cancer in Tunisia  seems to be mainly related to a delay in consultation of  women who live in "medical deserts" far from health facilities and radiology centers and who therefore have difficulty benefiting from screening mammograms.
Studies based on canine odorology  have shown promising results. Indeed, specially trained dogs are endowed with an infinitely developed sense of smell and could detect the presence of volatile organic bodies released by the tumor in human body fluids (urine, breath, sweat). These screening tests, simple, accessible, and low-cost, would be the ideal solution to overcome this delay in diagnosis and  reduce inequalities in access to screening, with a major collective impact on women's health. 
Therefore,this study aims to study the validity and reliability of the method of detecting breast cancer in Tunisian women by canine olfaction.

Normacol versus Povidone iodine versus placebo ","rectal preparation before prostate biopsy:
Normacol versus Povidone iodine versus placebo ","Prostate cancer is the world's leading cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men after lung cancer. Its diagnosis is based on histological evidence provided by a prostate biopsy (PB). This biopsy is performed by transrectal ultrasound guided in a systematized way and preceded by an antibiotic prophylaxis based on fluoroquinolones (FQ) recommended by all learned societies. Prostate biopsy is associated with complications, especially infectious ones, ranging from 1 to 4% according to the literature.

Due to the significant increase in the frequency of betalactamase-secreting bacteria in our country, the rate of complication rate is increasingly important.
The role of pre-biopsy screening for FQ-resistant bacteria is currently being evaluated.                                                                  
In view of the hypothesis put forward by different studies concerning the contamination of the prostatic parenchyma by germs coming from the rectal flora during transrectal prostate biopsy, several means of rectal preparation have been proposed in order to minimize the contamination of the puncture zone before the biopsy and to decrease the rate of septic complications.
In this study, we propose to compare two types of rectal preparation before prostate biopsy and to evaluate their interest in reducing the rate of infectious complications.

Objective(s) of the work

To evaluate the contribution of two methods of rectal preparation in reducing the incidence of post-PB infectious complications. 
To study the prevalence of urinary and digestive carriage of FQ-resistant bacteria in patients proposed for prostate biopsy.","RCT","Not Applicable","","Prevention","","1/1/2019 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","12/7/2021 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","144","120","Completed","","True","Single Site","Cancer","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table from a statistics book","","","Numbered containers","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Control Group; Experimental Group; Experimental Group","No rectal preparation; Povidone iodine; Normacol","; 10 cc ; 1 flacon of normacol","10 min; 30 min; 30 min","In this group, no rectal preparation was done before the prostate biopsy; the patient had a rectal preparation with povidone-iodine (10 cc in 90 cc saline); he patient had a rectal preparation with Normacol on the morning of the procedure ","40; 40; 40","Placebo; ; ","- Patients with a justified indication for biopsy:

TAM antagonizes tumor-cell estrogen receptors (ERs), whereas AIs block peripheral-tissue estrogen synthesis. In the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, 5-year fracture risk with anastrozole was 44% higher than that with TAM [2]. Similar fracture risk increases with letrozole or exemestane versus TAM for EBC in PMW were reported in the Breast International Group 1-98 and Intergroup Exemestane studies, respectively.
Earlier research has suggested that Zometa also might help stop breast cancer from spreading to the bones by making it harder for breast cancer cells to grow in bones and might help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurrence) in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Although, the time of starting and the duration of administration of Zometa are still unanswered in need to future research.
We will involve about 25 Patients of postmenopausal women who have ER/PR positive early breast cancer in each arm.
The study is a two-arm comparative, prospective, interventional, and randomized study. All patients who are on oral daily letrozole (2.5 mg), will be randomly assigned to receive either immediate or delayed ZOL (4 mg via 15-min infusion every 6 months) for 24 months. Immediate-ZOL patients will receive ZOL immediately after randomization; delayed-ZOL patients will receive ZOL only if their T-score fall below -2.0, after a nontraumatic clinical fracture, or if an asymptomatic fracture will be detected by spinal X-ray at the 3- monthly assessment.

A placebo looks like a drug but has no active ingredient.

Atezolizumab is a cancer immunotherapy and binds to a protein called PD-L1, blocking the usual function of PD-L1, in order to help your immune system to recognize and fight off cancer cells.  Atezolizumab (Tecentriq→) is approved for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (a type of bladder cancer), some lung cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (a type of liver cancer), melanoma (a type of skin cancer), as well as triple-negative breast cancer (which is a breast cancer that is different from the breast cancer you have).  However, in this study, atezolizumab is an experimental drug, which means that health authorities have not approved atezolizumab either alone or in combination with trastuzumab emtansine for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

Trastuzumab emtansine is a drug that combines trastuzumab (Herceptin→), a drug that attaches to HER2 proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and a chemotherapy drug.  Combining these drugs means that the chemotherapy drug is delivered specifically to cancer cells with HER2 on their surface and destroys them.  Trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla®) has been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.  However, trastuzumab emtansine is not approved in combination with atezolizumab which is the combination tested in this clinical trial.

This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of adjuvant atezolizumab when given in combination with trastuzumab emtansine compared with placebo and trastuzumab emtansine for patients with residual invasive HER2-positive breast cancer following neoadjuvant taxane-based and HER2-targeted therapy including trastuzumab, who are at high risk of disease recurrence.

Surgery of breast cancer may be associated with significant acute postoperative pain which is an independent risk factor in the development of chronic post-mastectomy pain. Various regional anesthetic procedures have been tried to provide better acute pain control and, consequently, less chronic pain. They can reduce perioperative opiates requirement and thereby decrease their possible side effects. Ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) provides analgesia over the anterolateral chest wall by blocking the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. Given its safety and ease of performance, SAPB has been increasingly used for analgesia in patients undergoing mastectomy. The ultrasound-guided transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block can block multiple anterior branches of the intercostal nerves (Th2–6), which dominate the internal mammary region providing analgesia of the anteromedial chest wall. Therefore, a combination of the SAPB and the TTP block may be effective for perioperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the combination of SAPB block and TTP block for breast cancer surgery, compared with the paravertebral block which is the most widely used analgesic regional technique for this type of surgery.

Approximately 70% of cases occur in men, and there is a 2- to 3-fold difference in incidence and mortality rates between the sexes worldwide (Bray et al. 2018). Most esophageal cancers can be categorized into two histological subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with differences in prevalence depending on the region. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common esophageal cancer in Asia and Africa, while adenocarcinoma is increasing in frequency in North America and Western Europe (Lin et al. 2013; Noone et al. 2017; Bray et al. 2018). Another major difference is the disease etiology: tobacco and alcohol abuse are the major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, whereas gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett’s esophagus are the two major risk factors for adenocarcinoma (Engel et al. 2003). Although the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophagogastric junctional carcinoma has increased in the United States and Western Europe, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma accounts for ~78% of all esophageal cases worldwide, and for ~90% of patients in the highest-risk regions of Northern Iran through Central Asia to North-Central China (Arnold et al. 2015; Edgren et al. 2013; Lagergren et al 2017).

Most esophageal cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, where the disease is frequently recurrent and treatment options can include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Treatments can extend survival but are largely palliative; and median survival time is less than 1 year (Zhang 2013; Smyth et al. 2017).

The prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remains poor, and 5-year survival rates are between 10%-20% across the United States, Europe, and Asia (Weidmann and Mössner 2013; Arnold et al. 2015; Lordick et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016; Murphy et al. 2017; Cheng et al. 2018; Ilson and van Hillegersberg 2018; NCCN 2019).

The impact of esophageal cancer on patients is multi-faceted. Most affected individuals present with physical symptoms, primarily dysphagia, which can result in unintentional weight loss and loss of appetite (Daly et al. 2000). However, patients with esophageal cancer also frequently report poor emotional well-being, and in particular high rates of anxiety and depression (Hu et al. 2015). Each of these symptoms has a significant impact on different aspects of patients’ functioning and quality of life. Hence, there remains a significant need for novel therapeutic agents for this patient population.

OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

pancreatitis, bleeding, and perforation are the most common complications, with rates ranging from 3 to 15%. ( Masci E et al., 2003).
When ERCP is not successful,  Traditionally those patients have been managed with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) or surgery (Ferrucci JT Jr et al., 1980). The potential complications associated with these procedures, along with the patient dissatisfaction associated with external drainage make these options less desirable.  (Artifon EL et al., 2006).
In recent years, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a purely diagnostic procedure to a therapeutic one. Wiersema et al. first reported EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography in 1996. Subsequently, EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography followed by biliary drainage (BD) has been performed with many case reports and series confirming both the success and safety of this technique. 
EUS-BD offers several advantages over both PTBD and surgery. First, EUS-BD can be performed at the time of the initial ERCP, without a need for further delay or additional procedures. In addition, EUS-BD provides internal drainage as opposed to the external biliary drain that accompanies PTBD and has been associated with significant patient dissatisfaction.

"PACTR202202585571226","Peptide supplementation for improving nutritional status of cancer patients","Application of bioactive peptide supplementation for attenuation of malnutrition in cancer patients in a treatment health facility in Ghana","Background: Generally, people with cancer are at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies and undernutrition compared with the rest of the population. Thus, malnutrition is prevalent in cancer patients and has been associated with poor therapy responses and unfavorable clinical outcomes. One major cause of undernutrition in cancer patients is that the various treatment methods - surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplant increase the body’s energy and protein needs, but at the same time makes it difficult for affected patients to eat adequately well. It has been found that these therapeutic modalities themselves, can cause gut malabsorption and imbalances of metabolism, which can further deteriorate a cancer patient ‘s nutritional status. Therefore, undernutrition in cancer patients impairs their quality of life, therapeutic responses, further leading to poor prognosis of the disease. Recent studies suggest that active peptides isolated from soybean have been proven to have a variety of physiological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties. Aim: Therefore, the study aims to investigate the effectiveness of food-borne (soybean) peptides in reducing malnutrition (muscle mass wasting) and improving overall quality of life among cancer patients in the Oncology Treatment Unit of the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Method: The study is a Clinical Trial. Cancer patients from the Oncology treatment Unit of the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, will be recruited and followed for 12 weeks. A signed informed- consent will be obtained from all the 80 cancer patients who will volunteer and give their content to participant in the study. Forty (40) patients with newly diagnosed primary tumors (such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumor, hematological system tumor, etc.) and 40 patients with newly diagnosed corresponding tumors will be randomly assigned to a control group (chemoradiotherapy group) and an experimental group (peptide + chemoradiotherapy group). Randomization into the various study groups will take into consideration the stage of the cancer infection so that subjects are stage-matched into the groups. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, quantitative and on the Body Mass Index (BMI), assessment of nutritional status (the patient's family members fill in the nutrition scale),weight changes (gains or losses), activities and body functions and overall quality of life will be obtained at baseline and after administration of the intervention. Information on baseline diets of all volunteer patients will be taken. Again, information on dietary intakes of all study participants will be obtained weekly using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Qualitative data on eating conditions, appetite changes will also be obtained. Safety assessment of the intervention will include adverse events, clinical laboratory examination, and physical examination (including vital signs/body weight). Expected result: The study envisages that administration of the supplement will improve cancer patient’s response to chemotherapy, quality of life, increase their life expectancy and survival rate.","RCT","Phase-0","","Physical activity and nutrition","","3/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","1/1/1900 12:00:00 AM","80","0","Active, not recruiting","","True","Single Site","Cancer","","","Parallel: different groups receive different interventions at same time during study","Randomised","Simple randomization using a randomization table created by a computer software program","","","Sealed opaque envelopes","Open-label(Masking Not Used)","","Control Group; Experimental Group","Dietary management; Peptides isolated from soya beans","Recommended adjustments to diet; 9 grams of peptides to be dissolved in water  to be taken twice  daily by participants","12 weeks; 12 weeks","The control treatment will

RAS/MAPK signal transduction pathway, an intracellular network of proteins that
transmit extracellular growth factor signals to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation,
and survival.  Mutations in KRAS can result in alterations at several amino acids,
including glycine 12 (G12), glycine 13, and glutamine 61, commonly found in solid
tumors and associated with tumorigenesis and aggressive tumor growth (Der et al. 1982;
Parada et al. 1982; Santos et al. 1982; Taparowsky et al. 1982; Capon et al. 1983). 
Oncogenic KRAS mutations that result in the change from G12 to cysteine (G12C) are
prevalent in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (~12%), colorectal cancer (CRC)
(~4%), and other tumor types (≤ 4%)(Bailey et al. 2016; Campbell et al. 2016; Giannakis
et al. 2016; Hartmaier et al. 2017; Jordan et al. 2017).
The available nonclinical data for GDC-6036, together with the early clinical data from
other covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors, support the proposed evaluation of GDC-6036 as
a single agent in this study. 
Specific therapies aimed at KRAS G12Cpositive cancer may provide more tolerable
and effective treatment options for patients with advanced stage cancers that harbor
KRAS G12C. Based on the nonclinical data available for GDC-6036 and on clinical data
from other covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors, the Sponsor has assessed the benefit-risk
profile of GDC-6036 as a single agent to be appropriate for initiating this first-in-human
clinical study.The mechanistic rationale along with data from in vitro and in vivo combination
studies (refer to the GDC-6036 Investigator's Brochure) have guided the selection of
anti-cancer therapies to be evaluated in combination with GDC-6036. Combination arms
of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD effects, immunogenicity

Consequently, many cancer patients are diagnosed late and outcomes are poor. Here, we propose to evaluate circulating tumour (ct)DNA analysis (“liquid biopsy”), a less invasive and faster approach to diagnose endemic EBV-driven lymphomas (EBVL) in East Africa.  We will evaluate the clinical utility of an already validated ctDNA test prospectively in a head-to-head comparison against histopathology including morphology, immunohistochemistry, and independent review. The primary endpoint is the time from presentation to the specialist centre to a final diagnosis of EBVL. Secondary endpoints include the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy and health economic benefits over histopathology. 
One forty-six patients will be recruited over 18 months. Patients will be eligible if they are 3-30 years of age and have provided written consent and/or assent. We will collect tissue and venous blood samples and process them as per established protocols. We will extract cell-free DNA from the double spun plasma, and prepare DNA libraries for sequencing on MiSeq. We will analyse the sequence data using a pre-validated lymphoma panel that detects acquired mutations frequently recurring in EBVL and that also spans the entire EBV genome. The time from presentation to diagnosis will be documented. We will then calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the method within 5% error margin and 95% confidence level.

Multimodal perioperative analgesia is highly recommended for post breast surgery pain, it includes gabapentine, paracetamol ± non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids, lidocaine based IV infusion and regional anaesthesia.
Ultrasound guided Transthoracic facial plane blocks are novel methods to control perioperative pain, and it is comparable with paravertebral plane block.
Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is an interfascial plane block, first described in 2016 by Forero et al  as an effective treatment for thoracic nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Its efficacy depends on the compartmental spread and the local anaesthetic (LA) distribution to nearby target nerves.
The initial clinical findings suggested that ESPB injectant would spread to both the dorsal and ventral ramus of the spinal nerves, leading to blockage of both somatic and visceral pain.
Cadaveric studies had been performed to assess the spread of dye in this novel block. However, not all of them have had extensive spread of dye. In one study, only minimal spread had been observed into the paravertebral space and in another it has been failed to demonstrate any spread at all into the paravertebral space or the ventral rami but there was extensive lateral and craniocaudal spread around the Erector Spinae (ES) complex.There are numerous factors affecting ESPB, among them is patient position, ESPB can be given in sitting, supine, and lateral decubitus positions; it is possible that the position of the patient when performing ESPB may affect the spread of local anaesthetic and thus the effect and quality of ESPB. To our knowledge no studies have examined this effect.

It is an aromatic shrub plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family commonly used to flavor many dishes, particularly among Mediterranean cuisines and in folk medicine since antiquity against rheumatism, cough, cardiac diseases, viral infections, diarrhea, etc., and as a general gastric secretion stimulant, carminative, diaphoretic and antiseptic. Laurus nobilis has been traditionally used for culinary and medical purposes. 
It is known in the field of herbal medicine and in vitro studies that Ln has beneﬁcial effects such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-diabetes, antihyperlipidemic, hepato-protective and anti-inflammatory properties.
Most of our knowledge about the therapeutic benefits of Ln on human health, comes from the field of herbal medicine and in vitro studies attributing to this plant virtues antibacterial, antifungal, anti-diabetes, antihyperlipidimic and anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies demonstrated that the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential indicator for determining inflammation in cardiac disorders, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease , major depressive disorder in patients with schizophrenia in a psychotic episode and in patients with bipolar disorder maniac episode . It was also reported that an elevated NLR is an important predictor of chronic stress in multiple species, including humans. 
OBJECTIVES.The purpose of this randomized, double-blind controlled trial, which will be include two groups [Experimental group (EG), control group (CG)], will be to investigate the effects of Laurus nobilis tea (Lnt) consumption on NLR and various complete blood count elements. The null hypothesis will be that the two groups will have similar NLR values, 10 days after the intervention.

Worldwide, the prevalence of PCOS is 6-13%. In Egypt, it is estimated that the prevalence of PCOS is 13% in fertile and 37.5% in secondary infertile patient (Ahmad Sameer Sanad 2013).  The symptoms of PCOS such as hirsutism, menstrual irregularity and infertility cause associated morbidities that generate negative consequences in the psychological and interpersonal functioning of individuals (El Hayek et al., 2016). PCOS has several serious complications. Estrogen levels are elevated, increasing risk of endometrial  hyperplasia  and,  eventually, endometrial  cancer.  Androgen levels are  often  elevated,  increasing  the risk  of metabolic syndrome and causing hirsutism. Hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance may be present and may contribute to increased ovarian production of androgens. Over the long term, androgen excess increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. [8]
Women with PCOS present an adverse reproductive profile, including a high risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus ((Palomba,  et al 2015). As one of the important treatment strategies for PCOS patients, adjusting lifestyle to lose weight was helpful to improve endocrine disorders and reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, which is widely used in clinical practice. For obese PCOS patients who receive assisted pregnancy treatment, dietary and exercise intervention before assisted pregnancy could help restore spontaneous ovulation and enhance natural pregnancy rate, improve the outcome of assisted pregnancy, increase the success rate of assisted pregnancy and reduce the risk of pregnancy complications((Wang 2019).).

","BACKGROUND 
Excess body weight is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders, causing nearly three million annual deaths worldwide. Currently, overweight and obesity are the most significant public health challenges, affecting more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide (Chávez-Guevara et al., 2020). Obesity is a growing risk to the health of people in developed nations, and has been described as an epidemic that has become a global health concern (Goettler, Grosse, & Sonntag, 2017). 

Obesity/overweight is an emerging problem in Africa (Adom, Puoane, De Villiers, & Kengne, 2017). In 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of being overweight and obese in the urban setting is 12.1% and 2.8% respectively. Also, a study on adults in Addis Abeba found that 25.7% and 24.7% of women and men respectively were overweight. There has been a widespread recommendation of all people to participate in physical activity to maintain a healthy life. As one of the most effective ways against these problems is exercise most specifically aerobic exercise, which can help reduce fat, lose weight, and change appearance. Aerobic exercise is a physical exercise that is performed when the body is fully supplied with oxygen (Sarojini, Priya, & Devi, 2019). 

Multiple studies prove that machine based exercise specifically the Arc trainer outperforms elliptical in important areas like calorie burn, muscular endurance, and work capacity and running on a treadmill generally burns calories faster than most other forms of in-home exercise (Kisan, Kisan, Anitha, & Chandrakala, 2012). As stated by (Taye, 2016), floor aerobic exercise should not be recommended during rapid weight loss. But, the results of (Biswas & Bose, 2019) study indicate that, both step aerobics training and floor aerobics training improved body composition in overweight and obese individuals. However there is a limitation of scientific study on the potential differences between the effect of floor and machine (treadmill and cross trainer running) based exercise on body weight loss and to decrease body fat percentage. Trainers in the study area have not common understanding, there was debate regarding the potential differences between the effect of floor and machine based aerobic exercise on body composition (weight loss and body fat percentage). 

OBJECTIVE
The research design of this study was experimental design specifically pretest-posttest randomized group design examining the effect of three different aerobics training modalities on change of body composition (body weight and percent body fat. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 12 weeks three aerobic training modalities on body composition among individuals with overweight and obesity in Debre markos university sport science gymnasium participants.

Methods and materials: The research design of this study was experimental design specifically pretest-posttest randomized group design examining the effect of three different aerobics training modalities on change of body composition (body weight and percent body fat. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 30 overweight and obese participants were selected and randomized to group either: floor aerobics intervention group (IG), n=10; machine (cross trainer and treadmill) aerobics IG, n=10 and combined (both floor & machine) aerobic training) IG, n = 10. Data was analyzed using paired t-test for within groups, one way ANOVA post hoc test for group comparisons and ANCOVA to control diet. Result: The findings of the study revealed that floor, machine and combined (both floor & machine) aerobic training group were significantly improved in body weight and body fat percentage (p<0.05; p=.000). There was no significant difference in body weight but there was a significant difference in mean body fat percentage improvement [F (2, 26) = 8.758, p=0.001] among the three aerobic training IGs. Post hoc tests showed there was a significant difference between floor and machine aerobic training (MD= -5.212, p = 0.016) and floor and combined (both floor and machine) aerobic training (MD= -6.834, p = 0.001). Comparing the estimated marginal means showed that the most body fat percentage was decreased in floor aerobic training (mean=23.104) compared to machine and combined aerobic training (mean=28.316, 29.937 respectively).
